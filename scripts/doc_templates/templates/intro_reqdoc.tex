This document lays out the detailed requirements for the  
ESMF \longname (\funcname).  It is the mechanism by which capabilities
desired for the \funcname implementation are identified and 
prioritized.  The \funcname implementation must also satisfy 
the requirements specified in the {\it ESMF General Requirements}
\cite{ESMFGenReq}.
