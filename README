                                   README

                    Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)

================================================================================

README file for ESMF v1.0 release.

The files contained here include the ESMF source code and build system.

More information about the ESMF project can be found at the ESMF web site:
	
	http://www.esmf.ucar.edu

For additional documentation on building and running the ESMF please see the
ESMF User's Guide on the ESMF Web pages, under the "Downloads &
Documentation" link.

The ESMF library source code is also available for download at:

  http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=38089

Follow the directions on that webpage to access the ESMF CVS repository.

================================================================================

QuickStart information for the impatient.

 - set environment variables ESMF_DIR and ESMF_ARCH (see below).
 - Type 'gmake' (the GNU make program) to build the ESMF library.
 - Type 'gmake tests' to make and run the unit tests
    (or 'gmake tests_uni' for non-mpi machines).
 - Type 'gmake system_tests' to make and run the system tests
    (or 'gmake system_tests_uni' for non-mpi machines).
 - Type 'gmake ESMF_COUPLED_FLOW' to compile and run a coupled fluid flow 
   demo program.  It will run in parallel, 4-way, compute 3600 time steps, and
   produce 10 data dumps.

Directories
-----------

CVS:            Contains the CVSROOT information.

build:          Contains the build system.

include:        There are currently no files in this directory.

scripts:        Contains scripts for testing and uniprocessor runs, and some
                templates.

src:            Contains the source code.

In addition, the following directories are created during the building and
testing stages:

lib:            Contains the ESMF libraries.

mod:            Contains the Fortran module files.

test:           Contains unit and system test executables and output.


System Information
------------------

The following platforms are supported: Alpha, IRIX64, IBM 32-bit and 64-bit 
addressing.


Environment Variables
---------------------

Currently the following environment variables must be set:

ESMF_ARCH     alpha, IRIX64, rs6000_sp (32-bit), rs6000_64
ESMF_DIR      top-level ESMF directory

On rs6000 machines an additional environment variable needs to be set to 
execute any of the tests or examples:

MP_RMPOOL     <Node allocation pool>

On Alpha machines an additional environment variable needs to be set:

ESMF_PROJECT  <Load Sharing Facility (LSF) project name>

On an Alpha machine, test and demo applications are run using the bsub command.  
The value of ESMF_PROJECT is used as the argument for bsub's -P option. The -P 
option assigns a job to a specific project.  

Environment variables must be set in the user's shell and not inside an ESMF 
makefile or build system file.  Here is an example of setting an environment 
variable in tcsh and csh shells:

	setenv ESMF_ARCH rs6000_sp

In ksh shell environment variables are set this way:

	export ESMF_ARCH=rs6000_sp


Build Information
-----------------

GNU make is required to build the library.  On most systems this will be just 
the command gmake.  On others it might be installed as gnumake or even just 
make.  In any event, use the --version option with these make commands to 
determine which is GNU make.

Build the library with the command:
 
  gmake BOPT=g 

for a debug version or

  gmake BOPT=O

for an optimized version.

To build and run the coupled fluid flow demo:

  gmake BOPT=[g,O] ESMF_COUPLED_FLOW

To build and run the system tests:

  gmake BOPT=[g,O] system_tests
  gmake BOPT=[g,O] system_tests_uni   ! for non-mpi machines

To build and run the unit tests:

  gmake BOPT=[g,O] tests
  gmake BOPT=[g,O] tests_uni          ! for non-mpi machines

To build and run the unit tests in exhaustive mode:

  gmake BOPT=[g,O] ESMF_EXHAUSTIVE=ON tests
  gmake BOPT=[g,O] ESMF_EXHAUSTIVE=ON tests_uni    ! for non-mpi machines

The exhaustive unit tests option is a *compile* time option.  Use

  gmake clean 

first if the unit tests have already been compiled without the 
ESMF_EXHAUSTIVE=ON option.

Output files from the tests are directed to files in 
$ESMF_DIR/test${BOPT}/${ESMF_ARCH} directories.

To build documentation:

  gmake dvi           ! Makes the dvi files
  gmake pdf           ! Makes the pdf files
  gmake html          ! Creates the html directory.
  gmake alldoc        ! Builds all the above documents.

Final documentation files will be located in the $ESMF_DIR/doc directory.
