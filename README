                                   README

        How to get and install the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)

================================================================================

The ESMF library source code is available for download at:

  http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=38089

Follow the directions on that webpage to access the ESMF CVS repository.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following platforms are supported: Alpha, IRIX64, IBM, Linux, Sun

Currently the following environment variables must be set:
ESMF_ARCH     alpha, IRIX64, rs6000_sp, rs6000_64
ESMF_DIR      top-level ESMF directory

On Alpha machines an additional environment variable needs
to be set:

ESMF_PROJECT  Load Sharing Facility (LSF) project name 

On an Alpha machine, test and demo applications are run using 
the bsub command.  The value of ESMF_PROJECT is used as the 
argument for bsub's -P option. The -P option assigns a job to 
a specific project.  

Environment variables must be set in the user's shell and not inside
an ESMF makefile or build system file.  Here is an example of setting
an environment variable in tcsh and csh shells:

	setenv ESMF_ARCH rs6000_sp

In Ksh shell environment variables are set this way:

	export ESMF_ARCH=rs6000_sp


GNU make is required to build the library.  On most
systems this will be just the command gmake.  On others 
it might be installed as gnumake or even just make.
In any event, use the --version option with these make 
commands to determine which is GNU make.


Build the library with the command:
 
  gmake BOPT=g 

for a debug version or

  gmake BOPT=O

for an optimized version.

To build and run the system tests:

  gmake BOPT=[g,O] system_tests
  gmake BOPT=[g,O] system_tests_uni   ! for non-mpi machines

To build and run the unit tests:

  gmake BOPT=[g,O] tests
  gmake BOPT=[g,O] tests_uni          ! for non-mpi machines

To build and run the unit tests in exhaustive mode:

  gmake BOPT=[g,O] ESMF_EXHAUSTIVE=ON tests
  gmake BOPT=[g,O] ESMF_EXHAUSTIVE=ON tests_uni    ! for non-mpi machines

The exhaustive unit tests option is a *compile* time option.  Use

  gmake clean 

first if the unit tests have already been compiled without the 
ESMF_EXHAUSTIVE=ON option.

Output files from the tests are directed to files in $ESMF_DIR/test${BOPT}/${ESMF_ARCH}
directories.

To build documentation:

  gmake dvi           ! Makes the dvi files
  gmake pdf           ! Makes the pdf files
  gmake html          ! Creates the html directory.
  gmake alldoc        ! Builds all the above documents.

Final documenation files will be located in the $ESMF_DIR/doc directory.

To use the library from C/C++, link with the appropriate library executable 
under $ESMF_DIR/lib and include the "ESMC.h" file.


To use the library from F90, link with the appropriate library executable under
$ESMF_DIR/lib.  Create links to the modules mfm_timemgmt.mod and 
mfm_timemgmt_types.mod in your application build directory.  Modules are 
in the $ESMF_DIR/mod directory.  To include the library in application modules, 
USE the module MFM_TimeMgmt.

There is an install target which will copy the library and mod files to an
install location.  To invoke this target use:

  gmake BOPT=[O,g] ESMF_LIB_INSTALL=dir_for_lib ESMF_MOD_INSTALL=dir_for_mod_files install 

Some users may wish for the library to be built in a directory different from 
where the source code resides.  To do this, build using:
  
   gmake ESMF_BUILD=build_directory_here BOPT=[O,g]

The ESMF_BUILD variable gives an alternate path in which to place the libraries,
mod files and object files.  This variable defaults to ESMF_DIR.  If it is 
assigned another value, the ESMF_BUILD variable will need to be passed as
an additional argument to the the above make commands.  (Alternatively the variable
ESMF_BUILD can be set in the environment (using setenv or export) and then it
need not be passed to any make calls).
