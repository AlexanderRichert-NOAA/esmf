================================================================================

README file for build directory.  

================================================================================

Besides this README file, the only other file that should be in this
directory is the makefile fragment common.mk.  The file common.mk
contains GNU makefile code used by the esmf build system used across
all platforms.  Users should have no reason to edit common.mk.

The only directory that should be here is a doc directory.  This 
directory contains tex files used for build system documentation.

See the README file in build_config for documentation on the
build system.  The ESMF User's Guide also has build system
documentation.
