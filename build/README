================================================================================

                 README file for build directory.  

================================================================================

This directory contains a makefile fragment, esmfuser.mk, which is intended
to be included in user makefiles.  It defines the compile flags needed to
locate the ESMF module files, and it defines the link flags and link libraries
needed to link applications which use the ESMF.  See 'makefile.sample' for
an example of how to use the esmfuser.mk fragment.  

Besides these files, the only other file that should be in this
directory is the makefile fragment common.mk.  The file common.mk
contains GNU makefile code used by the esmf build system across
all platforms.  Users should have no reason to edit common.mk.

The only directory that should be here is a doc directory.  This 
directory contains tex files used for build system documentation.

See README files at the top level of this distribution and in 
build_config for documentation on the build system.  The ESMF User's 
Guide also contains build system documentation.
