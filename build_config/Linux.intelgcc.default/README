Settings for Linux, using the commercial Intel Fortran compiler (ifort) and 
GNU C++ compiler (g++).

!!! This is also the correct configuration for SGI Altix systems !!!

Requires the following environment settings:

ESMF_COMPILER intelgcc

To incorporate MKL v10 into the build, for access to LAPACK, set:

  ESMF_LAPACK MKL

Currently the path to the MKL library files must be in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH in order
for the tests and examples to link and run.
