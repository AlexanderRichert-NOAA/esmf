Settings for Linux, using the gfortran compiler that comes with the GCC of
version 4.0.0 and up.

Requires the following environment settings:

ESMF_COMPILER gfortran

If a gfortran-compatible LAPACK library is available, specify the following
environment variables:

        ESMF_LAPACK             Defined when LAPACK is available
        ESMF_LAPACK_LIBS        Linker directives to link the library

Many Linux distributions provide precompiled versions of liblapack and libblas.
The usual well known locations for these are /usr/lib (or /usr/lib64 for 64-bit
ABIs.)  If your system has these, set ESMF_LAPACK to ON, and set ESMF_LAPACK_LIBS
to '-llapack -lblas'.

If your system does not appear to have a precompiled, gfortran-compatible, LAPACK
available, source code is available from the netlib website.  The URL is
http://www.netlib.org/lapack.  Likewise, a sample implementation of the
companion BLAS source code is available at http://www.netlib.org/blas.

If ESMF_LAPACK is not defined during the library build, a few portions of ESMF
which depend on it, notably the meshing routines, will be non-functional.
If these areas of the code are called, they will typically give an error
message and then STOP the run.
