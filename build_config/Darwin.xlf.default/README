The IBM xlf compiler is available now from Absoft for the Mac OS X
platform.  You can compile the ESMF libraries with either a mix of
xlf and gcc/g++ (the gnu C compilers), or with xlf and xlc/xlc++ 
(the IBM product C/C++ compilers).

If you want to compile with gcc, leave ESMF_C_COMPILER unset.
If you want to compile with xlc/xlc++ set the ESMF_C_COMPILER 
environment variable to 'xlc' before compiling.
