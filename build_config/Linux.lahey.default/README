Settings for Linux, using the commercial Lahey Fortran compiler and the
GNU C++ compiler (g++).

Requires the following environment settings:

ESMF_COMPILER lahey

Some versions of Lahey Fortran include a precompiled, and optimized version of
the LAPACK and BLAS libraries.  To use these, set the following:

        ESMF_LAPACK             1
        ESMF_LAPACK_LIBS        -lapack -blas

If a user-supplied Lahey-compatible LAPACK library is available, specify the following
environment variables:

        ESMF_LAPACK             Defined when LAPACK is available
        ESMF_LAPACK_LIBS        Linker directives to link the library

If your system does not appear to have a precompiled, Lahey-compatible, LAPACK
available, source code is available from the netlib website.  The URL is
http://www.netlib.org/lapack.  Likewise, a sample implementation of the
companion BLAS source code is available at http://www.netlib.org/blas.

If ESMF_LAPACK is not defined during the library build, a few portions of ESMF
which depend on it, notably the meshing routines, will be non-functional.
If these areas of the code are called, they will typically give an error
message and then STOP the run.
