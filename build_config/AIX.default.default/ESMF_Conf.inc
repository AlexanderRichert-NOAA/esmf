Apparently the AIX xlf 8.x compiler stopped being able to handle
initializers for derived type contents.  It accepts them
in some places, so I have not defined the normal symbol
which is ESMF_NO_INITIALIZERS that disables all initialization.
This symbol selectively disables initialization in the
places where it causes a compiler internal error.
