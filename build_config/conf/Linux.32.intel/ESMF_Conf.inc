the PGI compiler won't allow initializers.  on the theory that they
might be causing problems, don't includ them in the intel build either.
the build is currently making the compiler core dump in the bundle code.
see if this helps.

the PGI compiler has a bug which prevents forward pointer references from
working if also using the sequence keyword.  again, on the "things which
are hard for one compiler might be hard for another" theory, don't sequence
the forward references in states here either.
