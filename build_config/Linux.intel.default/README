Settings for Linux, using the commercial Intel Fortran (ifort) and C++ (icpc)
compilers.

!!! This is also the correct configuration for SGI Altix systems !!!

Requires the following environment settings:

ESMF_COMPILER intel

To incorporate MKL v10 into the build, for access to LAPACK, set:

	ESMF_LAPACK MKL

Currently the path to the MKL library files must be in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH in order
for the tests and examples to link and run.

If a user-supplied ifort-compatible LAPACK library is available, specify the following
environment variables:

        ESMF_LAPACK             Defined when LAPACK is available
        ESMF_LAPACK_LIBS        Linker directives to link the library

If your system does not appear to have a precompiled, ifort-compatible, LAPACK
available, source code is available from the netlib website.  The URL is
http://www.netlib.org/lapack.  Likewise, a sample implementation of the
companion BLAS source code is available at http://www.netlib.org/blas.

If ESMF_LAPACK is not defined during the library build, a few portions of ESMF
which depend on it, notably the meshing routines, will be non-functional.
If these areas of the code are called, they will typically give an error
message and then STOP the run.
