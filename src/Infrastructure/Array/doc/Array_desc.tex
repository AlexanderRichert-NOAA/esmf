The newArray class is an index space based, distributed data storage class. It provides DE-local memory allocations within DE-centric index regions and defines the relationship to the index space described by DistGrid. The newArray class offers common communication patterns within the index space formalism. As part of the ESMF index space layer newArray has close relationship to the DistGrid and DELayout classes.
