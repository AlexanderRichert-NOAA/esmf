%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Currently all native Fortran90 entry points to the Array API are severely limited with respect to type/kind/rank: only 2D and 3D 
{\tt real(ESMF\_KIND\_R8)} interfaces are implemented.
\item Non-blocking communication, PET-based and DE-based, has not been formulated or implemented.
\end{itemize}
