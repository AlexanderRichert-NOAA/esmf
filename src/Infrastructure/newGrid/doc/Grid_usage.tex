This section describes the use of the ESMF Grid class. It first discusses
the methods for Grid creation, and then describes the various options 
available when constructing an ESMF Grid. After Grid creation, it describes
data access and other useful Grid functionality. Finally, a series of Grid
usage examples are presented. 

  Something to keep in mind while reading the following descriptions of Grid usage is that 
the Grid is built on top of the Array and DistGrid, so many of the 
options and arguments are the same or similar to those used in these classes.
This might make things clearer for those who are familiar
with the use of Array or DistGrid.  Also, the documentation for these classes 
is a further source of examples and explanation for some of the ideas presented here.
