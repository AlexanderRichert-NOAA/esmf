C and C++ arrays are simple pointers to memory.
Fortran arrays contain shape and stride definitions and are strongly
typed. To enable interoperability between the languages the C++ code
must be able to obtain this information from the Fortran description
(which is called the "dope vector" in Fortran), either through a priori
knowledge or through query.
