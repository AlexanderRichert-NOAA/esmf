An ArraySpec is a very simple class that contains 
type, kind, and rank information about an array.  For those 
unfamiliar with Fortran:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Type} describes the data type of the elements in the array, 
such as integer, real, logical, etc.;
\item {\bf Kind} describes their precision; and
\item {\bf Rank} refers to their dimensionality.
\end{itemize}

The only methods that are associated with the ArraySpec class are those 
that allow you to set and retrieve this type, kind, and rank information.
