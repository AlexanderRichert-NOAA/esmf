A Field represents a scalar physical field, such as temperature.  
ESMF does not currently support vector fields, so the components of 
a vector field must be stored as separate Field objects.  The 
ESMF Field class contains the discretized field data, a reference 
to its associated grid, and metadata.  

The Field class maintains the relationship of
how data maps onto the Grid (e.g. one item per cell located at
the cell center, one item per cell located at the NW corner, 
one item per cell vertex, etc).  This means that different Fields
which are on the same underlying Grid but have different
mappings (staggerings) can share the same Grid object without
needing to copy or replicate it multiple times. 

The Field class provides methods for initialization, setting and 
retrieving data values, I/O, general data redistribution and regridding, 
standard communication methods such as gather and scatter, and 
manipulation of attributes.
