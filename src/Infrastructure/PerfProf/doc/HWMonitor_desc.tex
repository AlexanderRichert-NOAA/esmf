%\subsection{Description}

% <Describe class function and relation to other classes.>

The HWMonitor class handles the lower level libraries for
hardware performance monitoring (cache utilization, floating point operations
etcetera). It uses a middle layer library developed by other groups to provide 
a consistent interface to performance monitoring on all platforms. The current
design allows either the PCL or PAPI library to be used for this purpose. 

HWMonitor uses the Log and LogErr classes as well as the machine model class.
HWMonitor is a class meant for internal use by the Segment class only.
