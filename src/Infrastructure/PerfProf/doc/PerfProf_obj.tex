%\section{Object Model}

The following section describes design considerations for
the performance profiler and code timer, and the relationship 
between and subdivison of responsibilities into separate objects.

\subsection{Performance}

A Performance object when instantiated creates an array of
InstrumentedSegment objects that will be used to time individual
code sections.

\subsection{InstrumentedSegment}

A InstrumentedSegment object is made up of a ProfileClock object
and a HW\_monitor object.

\subsection{ProfileClock}

The ProfileClock object takes care of general timing to return
both wall-clock time and CPU time.

\subsection{HW\_monitor}

The HW\_monitor object takes care of hardware monitoring of code
sections.
