%\section{Object Model}

The following section describes design considerations for
the performance profiler and code timer, and the relationship 
between and subdivison of responsibilities into separate objects.

\subsection{Perf}

A Perf object when instantiated creates an array of
Segment objects that will be used to time individual
code sections.

\subsection{Segment}

A Segment object is made up of an array of Timer objects
and an array of HWMonitor objects. Each array is one
dimensional in the number of threads.

\subsection{Timer}

The Timer object takes care of general timing to return
both wall-clock time and CPU time.

\subsection{HWMonitor}

The HWMonitor object takes care of hardware monitoring of code
sections.
