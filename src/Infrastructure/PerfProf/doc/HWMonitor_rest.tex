%\subsubsection{Restrictions}

% <List class restrictions due to design or implementation strategies.>

The HWMonitor class is restricted for use on machines that either
have PCL or PAPI available. The design uses the platform independent
interface of these libraries for the actual interface to the hardware
monitoring. On initialization the class asks if a set of basic counters
are available on this machine through the middleware interface of PCL or 
PAPI. The code will abort if the complete set is not available. Since, the
set asked for should be available on any machine that has hardware monitoring,
this is not considered too restrictive.
