%\subsection{Design}

The Segment object has five main methods: SegmentCreate, SegmentBegin, SegmentEnd,
SegmentGetTime, and SegmentDestroy. SegmentCreate initializes values and
allocates memory for the maximum number of threads for an array of HWMonitor and Timer
objects. SegmentBegin, then queries the thread being used and prepares
monitoring for that given thread. SegmentEnd, again queries which thread is
being used and ends monitoring for that thread. SegmentGetTime figures out and
prints the timing statistics across all threads as well as distrubuted memory
tasks. Finally, SegmentDestroy, dealloces memory for the HWMonitor and
Timer arrays used in Segment.
