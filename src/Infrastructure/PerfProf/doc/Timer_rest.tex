%\subsubsection{Restrictions}

% <List class restrictions due to design or implementation strategies.>

The HWMonitor class is restricted for use on machines that either
have PCL or PAPI available. The design uses the platform independent
interface of these libraries for the actual interface to the hardware
monitoring. Also some platforms may not have some of the requested hardware
counters available. This may be because a given platform does not have 
the hardware requested (Level 2 data cache for example), or it may be because
hardware monitoring is not available. In either case only the available
statistics will be provided.
