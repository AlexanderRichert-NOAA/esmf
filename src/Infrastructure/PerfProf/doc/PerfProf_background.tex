\section{Background}

In order to efficiently optimize code, it is necessary to gain an understanding
of how much processor time is spent in individual code sections.  It is also
sometimes necessary to obtain hardware information such as number of flops,
cache hits/misses, and processor cycles, amongst other things.  With this
information in hand it is possible to identify code bottlenecks and re-arrange
a progam so that it calculates its results most efficiently.

The goal of this library is to provide a API for this type of profiling 
and to provide a reporting capability to nicely summarize the
results.

\subsection{Location}

The profiler is a part of the Infrastructure.  It is a low level class and does not have many
dependencies.  It will, however, be used by a number of the other classes in the library.

\subsection{Scope}

The profiler is responsible for code timings, and hardware profiling.  It also will report
the results of this survey.
