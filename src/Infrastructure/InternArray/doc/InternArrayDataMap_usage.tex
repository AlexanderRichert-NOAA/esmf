%\subsection{Use and Examples}

ArrayDataMaps are shallow objects.  They can be
declared as local (stack) variables in subroutines.
They do not need a create or destroy method.
There is a method to set initial values, to set
and query individual values, and to print the
contents in human-readable form for output or debugging.
