%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Native C++ vs. Fortran index ordering is not supported yet.}
ESMF currently assumes that all arrays are allocated from Fortran.
\item {\bf Complex interleave is not supported yet.}
ESMF does not yet support a complex type.  When we do, we expect that the
user will be able to specify either an all-real followed by all-imaginary
format or a real/imaginary interleaved format.

\end{enumerate}
