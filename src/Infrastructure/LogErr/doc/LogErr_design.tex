ACTIONS



1. A default log will be initialized when ESMF starts.

2. The user sets the parameters of the Log file via ESMF_LogSet.

3. The user gets the parameters of the Log file via ESMF_LogGet.

4. The user writes to a buffer or writes directly to the Log file via ESMF_LogWrite depending on the settings.

5. The user can flush the array via ESMF_LogFlush.

6. The user can have up to ESMF_LOG_MAXARRAYS "files" or distinct "streams" open.

7. There can be up to max_elements write messages in a single Log.

8. The log closes automatically when ESMF shuts down.



ASSUMPTIONS



1. Prior to closing, ESMF_LogFlush is always executed.

2. Prior to halting, ESMF_LogFlush is always executed.

3. If the number of elements in an ESMF_Log exceeds max_elements, a message is written to file and the buffer flushes.
