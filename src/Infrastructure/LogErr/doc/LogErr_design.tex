%\subsection{Design/Implementation}



ACTIONS



1. A default log will be initialized when {\tt ESMF} starts.

2. The user sets the parameters of the Log file via {\tt ESMF\_LogSet}.

3. The user gets the parameters of the Log file via {\tt ESMF\_LogGet}.

4. The user writes to a buffer or writes directly to the Log file via 
   {\tt ESMF\_LogWrite} depending on the settings.

5. The user can flush the array via ESMF_LogFlush.

6. There can be up to maxElements write messages in a single Log.

7. The log closes automatically when ESMF shuts down.



ASSUMPTIONS



1. Prior to closing, {\tt ESMF\_LogFlush} is always executed.

2. Prior to halting, {\tt ESMF\_LogFlush} is always executed and the {\tt Log}
   will show that a halt occured.

3. If the number of elements in an {\tt ESMF\_Log} exceeds {\tt maxElements, 
   then the buffer flushes automatically and resets.
