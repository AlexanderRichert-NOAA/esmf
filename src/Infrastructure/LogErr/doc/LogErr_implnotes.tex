%\subsection{Implementation Notes}

\begin{enumerate}

\item The Log class was implemented in C/C++, but uses the Fortran I/O libraries when
the class methods are called from Fortran. We forced the C/C++ methods 
to use the Fortran I/O library by creating 
utility functions that are written in Fortran, but callable from Log's C++ methods.
These utility functions call the standard Fortran write, open and close functions.
If you call the Log methods from C/C++ code, you bypass the utility functions
and all I/O is done with the C I/O libraries.

\end{enumerate}
