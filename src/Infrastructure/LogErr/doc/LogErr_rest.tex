%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Message writing methods are expanded using a macro that adds the
predefined symbolic constants \_\_LINE\_\_ and \_\_FILE\_\_ to the argument list.
Using these constants, we can associate a file name and line number with the
message.  If the CPP preprocessor is not used, this expansion will not be done
and the file and line number will not appear in the Log text.

Currently, the ESMF\_LogGet and ESMF_LogSet subroutines are not implemented.
Also, the flushing will occur after every write instead of allowing the user to
specify the buffer size.

ESMF\_LogInitialize and ESMF\_LogFinalize are called during ESMF\_Initialize and
ESMF_\Finalize so they do not need to be called if the default Log is used.  If
a new Log is required, ESMF\_LogOpen is used with a new new aLog object passed
in so that there are no conflicts with the default Log.

\end{enumerate}
