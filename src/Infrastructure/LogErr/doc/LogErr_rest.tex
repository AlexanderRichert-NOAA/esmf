%\subsubsection{Restrictions}


There are a few restrictions to keep in mind.  First, the error handling and
warning routines, ESMF\_LogErr()/ESMC\_LogErr(), ESMF\_LogErrMsg()/ESMC\_LogErrMsg(),
ESMF\_LogWarn()/ESMC\_LogWarn(),
and ESMF\_LogWarnErr()/ESMC\_LogWarnErr(),
are expanded using a  macro's that adds the
predefined symbolic constants \_\_LINE\_\_ and \_\_FILE\_\_ to the argument list of the above
error handling routines. Using these constants, we can determine the line number and file that ther
error occurred in.  If
your preprocessor is not working properly, this expansion will not be done properly and
the line and file names will not appear correctly when writing out error and warning
information. We also rely on the C and the Fortran preprocessor
to set a variety of symbolic constants (defined in ESMF\_LogConstants.inc and 
ESMF\_ErrConstants.inc).  Again, if your preocessor is not working properly, these
constants will not be set properly.
