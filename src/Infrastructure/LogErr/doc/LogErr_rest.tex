\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Line and file only available when using the C preprocessor}
Message writing methods are expanded using a macro that adds the
predefined symbolic constants \_\_LINE\_\_ and \_\_FILE\_\_ to the argument list.
Using these constants, we can associate a file name and line number with the
message.  If the CPP preprocessor is not used, this expansion will not be done
and the file and line number will not appear in the Log text.

\item{\bf Get and set methods not implemented.}
Currently, the {\tt ESMF\_LogGet()} and {\tt ESMF\_LogSet()} methods are 
not implemented.

\item{\bf Flush after write.}
Flushing occurs after every write instead of allowing the user to
specify the buffer size.

\item{\bf Avoiding conflicts with the default Log.}
The private methods {\tt ESMF\_LogInitialize()} and {\tt ESMF\_LogFinalize()} 
are called during {\tt ESMF\_Initialize()} and
{\tt ESMF\_Finalize()} so they do not need to be called if the default 
Log is used.  If a new Log is required, {\tt ESMF\_LogOpen()} is used with a 
new Log object passed in so that there are no conflicts with the default Log.
