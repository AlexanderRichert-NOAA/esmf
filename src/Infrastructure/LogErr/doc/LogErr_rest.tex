\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Line and file only available when using the C preprocessor}
Message writing methods are expanded using a macro that adds the predefined 
symbolic constants \_\_LINE\_\_ and \_\_FILE\_\_ to the argument list.
Using these constants, we can associate a file name and line number with the
message.  If the CPP preprocessor is not used, this expansion will not be done
and the file and line number will not appear in the Log text.

\item{\bf Get and set methods are partially implemented.}
Currently, the {\tt ESMF\_LogGet()} and {\tt ESMF\_LogSet()} methods are 
partially implemented.   

\item{\bf Log only appends entries.}
All writing to the log is appended rather than overwriting the log.  Future 
enhancements include the option to either append to an existing log or 
overwrite the existing log.

\item{\bf Avoiding conflicts with the default Log.}
The private methods {\tt ESMF\_LogInitialize()} and {\tt ESMF\_LogFinalize()} 
are called during {\tt ESMF\_Initialize()} and {\tt ESMF\_Finalize()} so they
do not need to be called if the default Log is used.  If a new Log is required,
{\tt ESMF\_LogOpen()} is used with a new Log object passed in so that there 
are no conflicts with the default Log.
