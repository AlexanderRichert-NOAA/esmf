%\subsubsection{Restrictions}

<List class restrictions due to design or implementation strategies.>

There are a few restrictions to keep in mind.  First, the error handling and
warning routines, ESMF\_LogErr(), ESMF\_LogErrMsg(), ESMF\_LogWarn(),
and ESMF\_LogWarnErr(),
are expanded using the standard fortran and C/C++ preprocessing  macro's the
predefined symbolic constants \_\_LINE\_\_ and \_\_FILE\_\_.  If
your preprocessor is not working properly, this expansion will not be done properly and
the line and file names will not appear correctly when writing out error and warning
information. We also rely on the C and the Fortran preprocessor
to set a variety of symbolic constants (defined in ESMF\_LogConstants.inc and 
ESMF\_ErrConstants.inc).  Again, if your preocessor is not working properly, these
constants will not be set properly.
