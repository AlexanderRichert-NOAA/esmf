%\subsection{Use and Examples}

The sequence of 

1. The user opens a Log file and retrieves an  ESMF_Log handle via ESMF_LogOpen.
2. The user sets the parameters of the Log file via ESMF_LogSet.
3. The user gets the parameters of the Log file via ESMF_LogGet.
4. The user writes to a buffer or writes directly to the Log file via ESMF_LogWrite depending on the settings.
5. The user can flush the array via ESMF_LogFlush.
6. The user can have up to ESMF_LOG_MAXARRAYS "files" open.
7. There can be up to max_elements write messages in a single Log.
8. The user closes the Log file via ESMF_LogClose.
9. The user can re-open a previously closed Log using ESMF_LogReopen

ASSUMPTIONS

1. Prior to closing, ESMF_LogFlush is always executed.
2. Prior to halting, ESMF_LogFlush is always executed.
3. If the number of elements in an ESMF_Log exceeds max_elements, a message 
   is written to file and the buffer flushes automatically.
