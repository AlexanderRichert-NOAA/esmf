%\subsection{Description}

The Log class consists of a variety of methods for writing error, warning, and
other log data to files or to standard out.  You may set options to make 
the output verbose or not, to halt on encountering errors or 
warnings, and to flush output buffers after every write.  Logs may be given
user-specified names, or, if desired, a default {\tt ESMF\_Log\_World} can 
be used.
