%\subsection{Description}

The Log class consists of a variety of methods for writing error, warning, and
informational messages to files.  A default Log is created at ESMF
initialization.  Other Logs can be created later in the code by the user.  A set
of standard return codes and associated messages are provided for error 
handling.  

Log provides capabilities to write to a file immediately or store entries in a 
buffer for writing either when the buffer is full, or when the user calls an 
{\tt ESMF\_LogFlush()} command.  Currently the default is set so the Log flushes
after every write command but can easily set to higher values using the 
{\tt ESMF\_LogSet} command and setting the {\tt maxElements} property to a value
greater than one.  The {\tt ESMF\_LogFlush()} command is automatically
called when the program exits (either by finishing or by using the {\tt halt}
property in the {\tt ESMF\_LogSet} command or when the Log is closed.

The user has the capability to halt the program according to the type of error
generated.  By using the {\tt ESMF\_LogSet} command with the halt property, the
user can halt the program when the halt property is set to 
{\tt ESMF\_LOG\_HALTWARNING} or {\tt ESMF\_LOG\_HALTWARNING}.  Additionally,
the user can choose to never halt by setting the halt property to
{\tt ESMF\_LOG\_HALTNEVER}.

Many options are planned for Log, including the ability to write to a single
file or multiple files, to write from a root PE or from all active PEs,to adjust
the verbosity of ouput, and to optionally write to {\tt stdout} instead of 
file(s).
