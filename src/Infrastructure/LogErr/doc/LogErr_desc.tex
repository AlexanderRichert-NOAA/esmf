%\subsection{Description}

The Log class consists of a variety of methods for writing error, warning, and
informational messages to files.  A default Log is created at ESMF
initialization.  Other Logs can be created later in the code by the user.  A 
set of standard return codes and associated messages are provided for error 
handling.  

LogErr provides capabilities to write to a file immediately or store entries in
a buffer for writing either when the buffer is full, or when the user calls an 
{\tt ESMF\_LogFlush()} command.  Currently the default is set so the Log 
flushes after every ten entries but can easily be set to other values using the 
{\tt ESMF\_LogSet()} command and setting the {\tt maxElements} property to 
another value greater.  The {\tt ESMF\_LogFlush()} command is automatically 
called when the program exits (either by finishing or by using the {\tt halt} 
property in the {\tt ESMF\_LogSet()} command or when the Log is closed.)

The user has the capability to halt the program on an error or on a warning.
By using the {\tt ESMF\_LogSet()} command and setting the {\tt halt} property 
to user can halt the program when the halt property is set to 
{\tt ESMF\_LOG\_HALTWARNING}, the program will stop on any waning or errors.
By setting the {\tt halt} property to {\tt ESMF\_LOG\_HALTERROR}, the program 
will only halt on errors.  Lastly, the user can choose to never halt by setting
the {\tt halt} property to {\tt ESMF\_LOG\_HALTNEVER}.

LogErr will automatically put the PET number into the log.  Also, the user can 
either specify {\tt ESMF\_LOG\_SINGLE} which writes all the entries to a single 
log or {\tt ESMF\_LOG\_MULTI} which wites entries to multiple logs according to 
the PET number.  To distinguish logs from each other when using 
{\tt ESMF\_LOG\_MULTI}, the PET number (in the format {\tt PETx.} will be 
prepended to the file name where x is the PET number.
 
Other options that are planned for LogErr are to adjust the verbosity of ouput, 
and to optionally write to {\tt stdout} instead of file(s).
