%\subsection{Description}



The Log class consists of a variety of methods for writing error, warning, 
and other messages to files or to standard out.  Options include the ability 
to write to a single file or multiple files, to write from a root PE or 
from all active PEs, and to halt at errors, at warnings, or never.  The 
verbosity of ouput can be adjusted with a flag.  Multiple Logs can be created 
within an application.  Logs may be given user-specified names, or, if desired, 
a default Log can be used.  



Log provides capabilities to write to a file immediately or store entries 
in a buffer for writing either when the buffer is full, or when the user
calls an {\tt ESMF\_LogFlush()} command.  The user can specify the number 
of entries that a Log should contain when it is flushed.  For buffered output, 
it's also possible to specify whether Log entries should be ordered or not.
