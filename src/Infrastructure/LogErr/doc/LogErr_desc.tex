%\subsection{Description}

The Log class consists of a variety of methods for writing error, warning, and
informational messages to files.  A default Log is created at ESMF
initialization.  Other Logs can be created later in the code by the user.  A 
set of standard return codes and associated messages are provided for error 
handling.  

LogErr provides capabilities to write to a file immediately or store entries in
a buffer for writing either when the buffer is full, or when the user calls an 
{\tt ESMF\_LogFlush()} method.  Currently, the default is for the Log to flush
after every ten entries.  This can easily be changed by using the 
{\tt ESMF\_LogSet()} method and setting the {\tt maxElements} property to 
another value.  The {\tt ESMF\_LogFlush()} method is automatically called when 
the program exits by any means (program completion, halt on error, or when the
Log is closed).

The user has the capability to halt the program on an error or on a warning.
By using the {\tt ESMF\_LogSet()} command and setting the {\tt halt} property 
to user can halt the program when the halt property is set to 
{\tt ESMF\_LOG\_HALTWARNING}, the program will stop on any waning or errors.
By setting the {\tt halt} property to {\tt ESMF\_LOG\_HALTERROR}, the program 
will only halt on errors.  Lastly, the user can choose to never halt by setting
the {\tt halt} property to {\tt ESMF\_LOG\_HALTNEVER}.

LogErr will automatically put the PET number into the Log.  Also, the user can 
either specify {\tt ESMF\_LOG\_SINGLE} which writes all the entries to a single 
Log or {\tt ESMF\_LOG\_MULTI} which wites entries to multiple Logs according to 
the PET number.  To distinguish Logs from each other when using 
{\tt ESMF\_LOG\_MULTI}, the PET number (in the format {\tt PETx.}) will be 
prepended to the file name where x is the PET number.
 
Other options that are planned for LogErr are to adjust the verbosity of ouput, 
and to optionally write to {\tt stdout} instead of file(s).
