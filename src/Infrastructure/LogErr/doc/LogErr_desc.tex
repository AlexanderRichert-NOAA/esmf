%\subsection{Description}

<Describe class function and relation to other classes.>
The Log class consists of a variety of methods for writing error, warning, and other
miscellaneous data to one or more files or to standard out. The class  allows the user
to use printf style routines (which are callable from fortran code) and fortran style 
write functions. The init method allows the user to set whether output should go to
standard out or not, whether the code should halt on encountering errors or warnings 
and other behavior.
