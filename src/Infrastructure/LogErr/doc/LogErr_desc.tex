%\subsection{Description}

The Log class consists of a variety of methods for writing error, warning, 
and informational messages to files.  A default Log is 
created at ESMF initialization.  Other Logs can be created later in the code
by the user.  A set of standard return codes and associated messages are 
provided for error handling.  

Log provides capabilities to write to a file immediately or store entries 
in a buffer for writing either when the buffer is full, or when the user
calls an {\tt ESMF\_LogFlush()} command.  Currently the Log flushes after
every write command.

Many options are planned for Log, including the ability 
to write to a single file or multiple files, to write from a root PE or 
from all active PEs, to halt at errors, at warnings, or never, to 
adjust the verbosity of ouput, and to optionally write to {\tt stdout} 
instead of file(s).
