%\subsection{Parameters}

\begin{description}

\item [RelLoc] Relative location defines where in each computational
cell a data item is located.  The framework needs to know this for
certain cases such as regridding, or for decomposition and halo
operations where the contribution of the data value may differ
depending on whether it is cell centered, along an edge, a face, etc.
