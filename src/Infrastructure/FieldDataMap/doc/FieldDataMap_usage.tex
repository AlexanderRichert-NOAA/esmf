%\subsection{Use and Examples}

FieldDataMaps are shallow objects.  They can be declared
as local (stack) variables in subroutines.  They do not
need a create or destroy method.  There is a method to
set the initial default values, to set and query individual
values, and to print the contents in human-readable form
for output or debugging.
