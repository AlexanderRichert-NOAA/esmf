%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf No support for vector Fields.} While vector interleave 
can be set and queried
in a FieldDataMap, no support for it exists in other
parts of this version of ESMF, since the Field class does not
support vector Fields yet.  The user can create a separate 
Field for each vector component.

\end{enumerate}
