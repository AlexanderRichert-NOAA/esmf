%\subsection{Description}

The Field DataMap class maintains information about the way an ESMF Array
object maps to the associated Grid in a Field object.  The Array class
maintains the linearization of multidimensional data to memory addresses,
but the Field DataMap class maintains the mapping between rank numbers and
Grid axes, information about vector or tensor interleaving, and information
about the relative location of the data item in each Grid cell.

The Field class implements methods for reordering or repacking
memory based on changes in the Field DataMap which can be 
transparent to the calling code.  None of the
methods based on changes in the Field DataMap class change 
data values; they simply change the mapping to memory addresses. 

The Field DataMap contains an Array DataMap as well as the
additional information required to carry out Field level operations.
