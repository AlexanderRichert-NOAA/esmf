The ESMF LocStream class is used to represent a set of points (the locations)
with descriptive data associated with each point (keys). A LocStream differs
from a Grid in that no topological structure is maintained between the points
(e.g. the class contains no information about which point is the neighbor
of which other point).

 A LocStream is typically used to represent the points at which a
set of observations has been measured. The key data is used to 
describe each location. This description can contain coordinates, or
other information which allows the locations to be identified. 

ESMF Fields may be created on a LocStream. The Fields can then be
used to hold information associated with each location. For example, 
the values measured at each observation point.
