The ESMF Grid class is used to describe the geometry and discretization
of logically rectangular physical grids.  It also contains the
description of the grid's underlying topology and the decomposition
of the physical grid across the available computational resources.
The most frequent use of the Grid class is to describe physical grids
in user code so that sufficient information is available to perform ESMF
methods such as regridding.
