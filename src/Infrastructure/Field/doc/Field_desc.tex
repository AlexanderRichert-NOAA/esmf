A Field represents a scalar physical field, such as temperature.  
ESMF does not currently support vector fields, so the components of 
a vector field must be stored as separate fields.  The ESMF Field
class contains the discretized field data, a reference to its associated
grid, and metadata.  The Field class provides methods for initialization, 
setting and retrieving data values, I/O, intercomponent data 
exchange, data regridding, standard communication methods such as 
gather and scatter, and manipulation of attributes.
