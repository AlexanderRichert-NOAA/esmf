An ESMF Field represents a physical field, such as temperature.
The motivation for including Fields in ESMF is that bundles of 
Fields are the entities that are normally exchanged when coupling
Components.
  
The ESMF Field class contains discretized field data, a reference 
to its associated grid, and metadata.  The Field class maintains the
relationship of how a data array maps onto a grid (e.g. one item per
cell located at the cell center, one item per cell located at the NW
corner,  one item per cell vertex).  This means that different Fields
which are on the same underlying ESMF Grid but have different
staggerings can share the same Grid object without needing to replicate
it multiple times. 

ESMF does not currently support vector fields, so the components of 
a vector field must be stored as separate Field objects.  

The Field class provides methods for initialization, setting and 
retrieving data values, general data redistribution and regridding, 
standard communication methods such as gather and scatter, and 
manipulation of attributes.  Field methods are called from objects
internal to the framework and can also be called from user code.
