\section{Glossary}

\begin{description}

\item [Grid] \label{glos:grid} A grid is a complete computational entity
describing the discretization of a field in space and the partition 
and arrangement of the cells within that field on a computer.
It contains both a distributed grid and a physical grid.

\item [Field] \label{glos:fld} A field is a tangible or derived quantity
defined within a continuous region of space.  The computational representation 
of a field includes the physical grid associated with the field and a 
decomposition that specifies how data associated with points in the 
physical grid are distributed in computer memory and/or how computational 
work is divided among threads.  A field may also include a specification 
of gridpoint staggering.

\item [Bundle] \label{glos:bundle} A bundle refers to a set of fields that 
are associated with the same physical grid and distributed in a similar 
fashion across the same physical axes.  Fields within a bundle may be
staggered differently and may have different dimensions.

\item [Packed Bundle] \label{glos:packedbundle} A packed bundle is arranged
so that field data is contiguous in memory.

\item [Loose Bundle] \label{glos:loosebundle} A loose bundle consists of 
fields whose data is not contiguous in memory.
