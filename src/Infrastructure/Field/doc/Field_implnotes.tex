%\subsection{Design and Implementation Notes}

\begin{enumerate}

\item The Field class aggregates two internal subclasses: a GlobalField class
and a LocalField class.  This separation allows the code to clearly
differentiate between functions which operate internal to a single DE
on a local decomposition of data, and those which must be aware of the
global state of the Field.  There is a correspondence between the Global 
Distributed Grid class, and the Local Distributed Grid class, and Fields.  
Each DE contains the corresponding local decompositions for Distributed Grids 
and Fields.

\item Some methods which have a Field interface will actually be
implemented at the underlying Grid or Array level; they
will be inherited by the Field class.  This allows the user
API (Application Programming Interface) to present functions at
the level which is most consistent to the application without
restricting where inside the ESMF the actual implementation
is done.
