\section{Background}

The capabilities most fundamental to ESMF are the efficient transformation and 
transferral of field data between model components.  Fields within a model 
component are frequently associated with the same physical grid (though
staggering may be different) and similarly decomposed in memory.
Thus the basic currency exchanged between components is a bundle of fields 
associated with the same {\bf grid}, or simply a {\bf bundle}.  

\subsection{Location}
Fields and bundles are part of the Fields and Grids layer of the 
ESMF Infrastructure.

\subsection{Scope}

Fields may be defined in physical or spectral space, and may be scalar or 
vector. 

Field and bundle operations are limited to configuration, manipulation
and querying of attributes, accessing data, setting and retrieving data 
values, I/O, and regridding.  The first releases of ESMF will not provide 
differential or other mathematical operators on fields; the framework may 
be extended to include such methods in the future.
