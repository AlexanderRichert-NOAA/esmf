The maximum number of alarms that can be associated with a clock is hard-coded
at 20.  This is done in both F90 and  C++ with a \#define for ease of
modification.  See the F90 and C++ "Parameters and Definitions" sections below.
If needed, this can be changed in a future release to a dynamic value passed
in during runtime initialization.  But the requirement for no dynamic memory
allocation would have to be relaxed.
