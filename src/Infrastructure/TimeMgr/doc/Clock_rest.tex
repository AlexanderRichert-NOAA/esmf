\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Limit on number of Alarms.}  The maximum number of alarms that 
can be associated with a clock is hard-coded
at 20.  This is done in both F90 and  C++ with a \#define for ease of
modification.  If needed, this can be changed in a future release to a 
dynamic value passed in during runtime initialization.  But the requirement 
for no dynamic memory allocation would have to be relaxed.
