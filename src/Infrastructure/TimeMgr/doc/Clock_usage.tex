The following is a typical sequence for using a Clock in a 
geophysical model.

\noindent {\bf At initialization:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a Calendar.
\item Set start time, stop time and time step as Times and 
Time Intervals.
\item Create a Clock using the start time, stop time and time
step to initialize it.
\item Define Times and Time Intervals associated with special
events, and use these to create Alarms.
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf At run:}
\begin{itemize}
\item If Advance the Clock, checking for ringing alarms as needed.
\item Check if it is time to stop.
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf At finalize:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Destroy the Clock 
\item Destroy the Calendar
\end{itemize}

The following code example illustrates Clock usage.
