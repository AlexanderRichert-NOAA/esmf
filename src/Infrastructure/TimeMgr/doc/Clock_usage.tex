The following is a typical sequence for using a Clock in a 
geophysical model.

\noindent {\bf At initialize:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Set a Calendar.
\item Set start time, stop time and time step as Times and 
Time Intervals.
\item Set a Clock using the start time, stop time and time
step to initialize it.
\item Define Times and Time Intervals associated with special
events, and use these to set Alarms.
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf At run:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Advance the Clock, checking for ringing alarms as needed.
\item Check if it is time to stop.
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf At finalize:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Since Clocks, Alarms, Times and TimeIntervals are all lightweight
classes, they don't need to be explicitly destroyed at finalization.
\end{itemize}

The following code example illustrates Clock usage.
