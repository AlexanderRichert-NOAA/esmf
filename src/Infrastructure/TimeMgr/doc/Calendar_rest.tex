Due to the requirement of only Earth modeling and the requirement for no
dynamic memory allocation, the number of months per year is hard-coded
at 12.  However, for easy modification, this is done via an F90 parameter
and a C++ \#define.  See the F90 and C++ "Parameters and Definitions" sections
below.
