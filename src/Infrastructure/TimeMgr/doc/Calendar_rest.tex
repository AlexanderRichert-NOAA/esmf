Due to the requirement of only Earth modeling and the requirement for no
dynamic memory allocation, the number of months per year is hard-coded
at 12.  However, for easy modification, this is done via an F90 parameter 
and a C preprocessor \#define.  See the F90 and C++ "Parameters and 
Definitions" sections below.
