The Alarm class contains TimeInstants and a TimeInterval to perform one-shot
and interval alarming.  A single TimeInterval holds the alarm interval if
used.  A TimeInstant is defined for the ring time, used for either the one-shot
alarm time or for the next interval alarm time.  TimeInstants are also
defined for next and previous ring times in keeping track of alarm intervals.
A TimeInstant for stop time defines when alarm intervals end.  If a one-shot
alarm is defined, only the ring time attribute is used, the others are not.
To keep track of alarm state, two logical attributes are defined, one for
ringing on/off, and the other for alarm enabled/disabled.  An alarm is 
enabled by default; if disabled by the user, it does not function at all.

The primary method is to check whether it is time to set the ringer, which
is called by the associated clock after performing a time step.  Other methods
are defined for getting the ringing state, turning the ringer on/off,
enabling/disabling the alarm, and getting/setting the time attributes
defined above.
