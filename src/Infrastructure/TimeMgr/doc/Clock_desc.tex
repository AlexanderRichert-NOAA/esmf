\label{sec:Clock}

The Clock class advances model time and tracks its associated
date on a specified Calendar.  It stores start time, stop time,
current time, and a time step (which may be changed while a 
Component runs).  A Clock also stores a list of Alarms, which can
be set to flag events that occur at a specified time instant or at 
a specified time interval.  See Section~\ref{sec:Alarm} for 
details on how to use Alarms.

There are methods for creating a Clock and setting and getting
the quantities associated with it.  Methods are defined for 
advancing the Clock's current time, checking if the
stop time is reached, and synchronizing with a real clock.
