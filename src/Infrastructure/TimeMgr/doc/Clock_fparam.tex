The Clock class has one parameter limiting the number of alarms that can be
associated with it.  In F90 this is

        integer, parameter :: MAX\_ALARMS = 10

If needed, and the non-dynamic memory requirement is lifted, this could be
changed in a future release to a dynamic value passed in during run-time
initialization.
