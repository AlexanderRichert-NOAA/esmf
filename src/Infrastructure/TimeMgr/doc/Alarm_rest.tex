\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Alarm list allocation factor}  The alarm list within a clock is
dynamically allocated automatically, 200 alarm references at a time.
This constant is defined in both Fortran and C++ with a \#define for ease
of modification.

\item {\bf Sticky alarms in reverse}  For sticky alarms, there is an implicit
limitation that in order to properly reverse timestep through a ring end
time, that time must have already been traversed in the forward direction.
This is due to the fact that the Time Manager cannot predict when user code
will call {\tt ESMF\_AlarmRingerOff()}.  An error message will be logged when
this limitation is not satisfied.

\end{enumerate}
