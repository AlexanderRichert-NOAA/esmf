\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Limit on number of Alarms.}  The maximum number of Alarms that 
can be associated with a Clock is currently hard-coded at 100.  This is done
in both F90 and C++ with a \#define for ease of modification.  This will be
changed in a future release to an automatic dynamic memory allocation approach,
so the number of alarms will be virtually unlimited, subject only to the amount
of memory available to a user's process.

\end{enumerate}
