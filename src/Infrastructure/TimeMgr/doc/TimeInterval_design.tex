\noindent {\it Implementation Notes}

It is useful to allow both {\tt TimeIntervals} and {\tt Times} to 
inherit from a single class, {\tt BaseTime}.  As such,
it gains the core representation of time as well as its associated methods.
{\tt TimeInterval} further specializes {\tt BaseTime} by adding shortcut
methods to set and get a {\tt TimeInterval} in a natural way with
appropriate unit combinations.  In order to support calendar intervals,
{\tt TimeInterval} adds a calendar type attribute to {\tt BaseTime}.
