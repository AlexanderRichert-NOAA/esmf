TimeInstant inherits from the base class Time.  As such, it gains the core
representation of time as well as its associated methods.   TimeInstant
further specializes Time by adding shortcut methods to set and get a
TimeInstant in a natural way with appropriate unit combinations, as per the
requirements.  A TimeInstant is calendar-dependent, since its largest units
of time are months and years.  TimeInstant also defines special methods for
getting the day of the year, day of the week, middle of the month, and
synchronizing with a real-time clock.  TimeInstant adds its associated
Calendar and local Timezone attributes to Time.
