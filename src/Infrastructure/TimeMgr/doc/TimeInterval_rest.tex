\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Limits on time span.} The limits on the time span that can be represented are 
based on the
64-bit and 32-bit integer types used.  For seconds, a signed 64-bit integer
will have a range of +/- 2\^63-1, or +/- 9223372036854775807.  This corresponds
to a range of +/- (2\^63-1)/(86400 * 365.25) or +/- 292,271,023,045 years.
