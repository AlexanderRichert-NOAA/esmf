The Time class is not intended for users; it is only used internally as a base
class for TimeInterval and TimeInstant.  The F90 definition for
TimeInstant is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
        use ESMF_TimeMod

        type ESMF_TimeInstant
            private
            sequence
                type(ESMF_Time) :: time		! <== "inherits" base class
                integer :: calendar
                integer :: timezone
        end type
\end{verbatim}
