In most Earth system applications, the timekeeping in each Component 
must refer to the same standard calendar in order for the Components 
to properly synchronize.  In the interests of reducing the possibilities
for conflixt, it makes sense to create as few ESMF Calendars as possible.
A typical strategy would be to create a single Calendar at the start
of an application, and use that Calendar in all subsequent calls that
accept a Calendar, such as {\tt ESMF\_TimeSet}.

The following example shows how to set up an ESMF Calendar in F90.
