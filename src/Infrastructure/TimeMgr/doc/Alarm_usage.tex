Alarms are used in conjunction with Clocks (see Section~\ref{sec:Clock}).
Multiple Alarms can be associated with a Clock.
During the {\tt ESMF\_ClockAdvance} method, a Clock iterates over its 
internal Alarms
to determine if any are ringing.  Alarms ring when a specified Alarm 
time is passed, taking into account whether the time step is positive 
or negative.  On completion of the time advance call, the Clock returns
the number of ringing Alarms.

The user can then check  if the number of ringing Alarms is greater than zero.  If so, the user
goes into a loop to query the Clock for each ringing Alarm, one at a time.
Each ringing Alarm can then be processed using Alarm methods for identifying,
turning off, disabling or resetting the Alarm.

Alarm methods are defined for getting the ringing state, turning the
ringer on/off, enabling/disabling the Alarm, and getting/setting 
associated times.

The following example shows how to set and process Alarms.
