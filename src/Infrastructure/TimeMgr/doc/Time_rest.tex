\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Limits on size and resolution of Time.}  The limits on the size and 
resolution of the time representation are based on the
64-bit and 32-bit integer types used.  For seconds, a signed 64-bit integer
will have a range of +/- 2\^63-1, or +/- 9223372036854775807.  This corresponds
to a maximum size of +/- (2\^63-1)/(86400 * 365.25) or +/- 292,271,023,045 
years.

For fractional seconds, a signed 32-bit integer will handle a resolution of
+/- 2\^31-1, or +/- 2,147,483,647 parts of a second.
