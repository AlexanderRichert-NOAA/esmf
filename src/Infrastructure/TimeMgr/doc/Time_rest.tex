The limits on range and resolution of time representation are based on the
64-bit and 32-bit integer types used.  For seconds, a signed 64-bit integer
will have a range of +/- 2\^63-1, or +/- 9223372036854775807.  This corresponds
to a range of +/- (2\^63-1)/(86400 * 365.25) or +/- 292,271,023,045 years, or
about 6 orders of magnitude greater than the required +/- 200,000 years!

For fractional seconds, a signed 32-bit integer will handle a resolution of
+/- 2\^31-1, or +/- 2,147,483,647 parts of a second, which is about twice
that of the required nanosecond resolution.
