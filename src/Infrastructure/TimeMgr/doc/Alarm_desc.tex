\label{sec:Alarm}
The {\tt Alarm} class encapsulates the required alarm behavior, triggering
its ringing state on either a one-shot or repeating interval basis.  Multiple
alarms can be associated with a clock, which checks the ringing state of each
of its alarms after every time step. Users check for and process ringing
alarms after each time step of the associated clock.
