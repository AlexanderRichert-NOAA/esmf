\label{sec:Alarm}
The Alarm class identifies events that occur at specific Times
or specific TimeIntervals by returning a true value at those times
or later, and a false value otherwise.  Multiple Alarms can be 
associated with a Clock.  Users can check for and process ringing
Alarms after each time advance of the associated Clock.
