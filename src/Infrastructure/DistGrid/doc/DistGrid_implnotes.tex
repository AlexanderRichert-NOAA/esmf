%\subsection{Implementation Notes}

The DistGrid class contains the mapping between the local grid decompositions
and the global logical Grid.  It contains methods to synchronize data values
between the boundaries of subsets, and to collect and communicate global data
values. It interacts closely with the PhysGrid object.

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf DistGrid Internal Classes}

The DistGrid class aggregates the DELayout class as well as two internal subclasses,
the DistGridGlobal and DistGridLocal classes.  The separation between DistGridGlobal
and DistGridLocal allows the code to clearly differentiate between functions which
operate internal to a single DE on a local decomposition of data, and those which
must be aware of the global state of the distribution.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf DELayout} The DELayout class is described in detail in the Utilities
section of this document.
\item {\bf DistGridGlobal} The DistGridGlobal class contains general information
about each of the partitions that the entire grid has been decomposed into. This
includes information about how each part relates to the whole, how many points/cells
there are per decomposition, etc.  This information allows DistGrid to compute
information about other decompositions on other PEs without having to do communication
first.
\item {\bf DistGridLocal} The DistGridLocal class contains detailed subgrid
information for the data located on this PE, such as the local cell count and the
number of cells along each axis and their position in the global Grid.  When we
implement multiple DEs per PE then we will have a list of these instead of a single
one in the DistGrid class.
\end{itemize}

\item {\bf Local verses Global Data}

The primary purpose of DistGrid is to encapsulate information
about the local decomposition(s) (DE) of the Grid on this PE.  
This includes such information as the total 
number of local cells, if logically rectangular the numbers of cells along 
each dimension, and the relative location of this DE compared to the
overall ESMF\_Grid.  The minimum information required would be
to compute and store data only for the local DE.

However, at create time DistGrid computes information not only about the
local decomposition, but also less detailed information about the other
decompositions for the entire Grid.  While this duplicates some data, it
avoids communication when a DE requires information to enable it to send data to 
or receive data from other DEs, 

\item {\bf Boundary Cells}

As part of the create-time computation DistGrid computes sizes and lengths
for the local DE grid cells, and also does a secondary computation 
of sizes and lengths taking into account a layer of boundary cells around 
each DE.  These boundary cells are distinct from the halo cells which are
specified on a per-Field basis and are visible to the user code.

The boundary cells inside DistGrid are only used internally to the Framework,
for example during regridding to avoid unnecessary inter-DE communication and
to handle exterior boundaries in a consistent manner.

\end{enumerate}





Some methods which have a DistGrid interface will actually be
implemented at the underlying DELayout or Array level; they
will be inherited by the DistGrid class.  This allows the user
API (Application Programming Interface) to present functions at
the level which is most consistent to the application without
restricting where inside the ESMF the actual implementation
is done.


The DistGrid class has two instances of both DistGridLocal and
DistGridGlobal classes, one to represent the computational domain and one to represent
the total domain, which includes halo and ghost cells as well as computational cells.
