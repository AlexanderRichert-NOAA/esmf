The {\tt ESMF\_DistGrid} class sits on top of the DELayout class and holds domain information in index space. A DistGrid object captures the index space topology and describes its decomposition in terms of DEs. Combined with DELayout and VM the DistGrid defines the data distribution of a domain decomposition across the computational resources of an ESMF component.

The global domain is defined as the union or ``patchwork'' of logically rectangular (LR) sub-domains or patches. The DistGrid create methods allow the specification of such a patchwork global domain, which may be decomposed into exclusive, DE-local LR regions according to various degrees of user specified constraints. Complex index space topologies can be constructed by specifying contact relationships between LR patches during creation. 

The DistGrid class holds domain information for all DEs. Each DE is associated with a local LR region. No overlap of the regions is allowed. The DistGrid offers query methods that allow DE-local topology information to be extracted, e.g. for the construction of halos by higher classes.

The DistGrid only contains decomposable dimensions. The rank of a DELayout contained in a DistGrid is equal to the DistGrid rank. Higher classes that use DistGrid may be of higher rank, keeping track of which dimensions map to DistGrid dimensions.
