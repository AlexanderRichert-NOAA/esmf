ALL: build_examples

#
#  makefile for examples directory.
# 
# All of the makefile targets and rules for building and linking
# examples are located in the build system makefile fragments.
# The run targets are located in this makefile.
#
# Applications and their standard output files are created in
# $(ESMF_EXDIR).  $(ESMF_EXDIR) is defined in build/common.mk.
#
# Targets:
#
#    examples:         Will first build the ESMF library, then will 
#                      build the example applications and finally 
#                      will run the examples
#
#    examples_uni:     Same as examples target, but runs examples on  
#                      a single processor.
#
#    build_examples:   Builds example applications in $(ESMF_EXDIR)
#
#    run_examples:     Runs applications built from source in this
#                      directory.  Output is saved in file in $(ESMF_EXDIR).
#
#    run_examples_uni: Same as run_examples target, but runs examples on 
#                      only one processor.
