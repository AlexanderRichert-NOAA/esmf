The alarm class returns {\tt TRUE} boolean values when a condition 
specified during alarm initialization occurs.  The alarm will
stay ``on'' until it is reset to {\tt FALSE}.  Monthly and yearly 
alarms turn on at month and year boundaries.  Periodic alarms will
also be available but have not yet been fully implemented.
