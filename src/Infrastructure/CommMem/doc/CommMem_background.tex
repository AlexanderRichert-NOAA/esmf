\section{Background}

The communication and memory kernels elements of ESMF provide a set of
services that shield the upper levels of ESMF from system
level functions. Two related ares are addressed. The basic communication
primitives that are building blocks for both the 
data communication between and within components and the
control messages that components may need to exchange.


One reason for isolating this section of ESMF is to help
absract the communication primitives to allow highly optimized code,
targeted to specific platforms and to specific framework functions
to be easliy inserted into ESMF. The {\bf \shortname}
layer will allow specialized forms of performance critical
primitives to be employed without impacting application
code or upper layers of ESMF code.

Channeling communication and ESMF memory allocation through a single 
layer is also designed to support detiled application-level 
monitoring.
