The DE class encapsulates a process or thread's identifying information.  This
includes whether the DE is a process or a thread as well as a system-dependent
process ID or thread ID, respectively.  A system-independent ESMF ID is also
assigned to the DE.  In addition, the PE on which the DE is running is
captured.  Upon system startup, a DE object is instantiated within each process
or thread.  The DE object self-discovers its ID information as well as its PE
assignment.  This is information is gathered across all DEs, and in
conjunction with the PE list, is used to create the DELayout.
