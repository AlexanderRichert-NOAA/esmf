The Comm class has an interface which looks similar to MPI.  Depending on
whether the DE it is communicating on behalf of is a process or a thread, it
will use MPI or pthreads to accomplish the desired communication, respectively.
In the case of a main() thread, which is also the parent process, it will
first perform pthreads communication within the node with its sub-threads,
and then MPI communication across nodes with other process/thread groups.
