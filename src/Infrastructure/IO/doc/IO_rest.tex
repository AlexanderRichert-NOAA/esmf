\begin{enumerate}

Currently a small fraction of the formats is implemented by ESMF.  
The data IO uses by NetCDF and binary formats, and ESMF Attribute
IO uses XML format.  Different libraries are employed for these 
different formats and data IO. In the future development, a IO Class
is defined to provide efficient utilities with a set of standard
APIs that will allow manipulation of multiple standard formats.
