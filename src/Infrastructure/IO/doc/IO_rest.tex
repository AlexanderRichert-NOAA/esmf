Currently a small fraction of the formats is implemented by ESMF.  
The data IO uses NetCDF and binary formats, and ESMF Attribute
IO uses XML format.  Different libraries are employed for these 
different formats.  In future development, a more centralized IO technique
will likely be defined to provide efficient utilities with a set of standard
APIs that will allow manipulation of multiple standard formats.
