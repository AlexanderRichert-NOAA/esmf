%=============================================================================

The following are requirements for IO operations and are in addition
to the applicable general ESMF requirements (see ESMF General 
Requirements document, section 8.1.3).

\req{General IO Requirements}

\sreq{Determine ESMF Metadata Conventions}

A set of metadata conventions on gridded data on structured and
unstuctured grids, as well as observational data has to be determined
within ESMF. The ESMF metadata conventions will be an extension of the NetCDF 
Climate-Forecast (CF) Metadata Convensions \cite{NetCDF_CF_v1_beta3}.


\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO, NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Document inspection \\
\end{reqlist}

files for structured gridded data covered by ESMF metadata conventions.

\sreq{Reading and Writing GRIB files}

ESMF has to provide interfaces and software to read and write GRIB
files for for structured gridded data covered by ESMF metadata conventions. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1 \\
{\bf Source:} NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Although GRIB1 is currently in operational use at NCEP,
it is proposed that ESMF will support GRIB2 format assuming transition
in the next two years.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Reading and Writing Native Binary Files accompanied by metadata}

ESMF has to provide interfaces and software to read and write native
binary files for structured gridded data for each machine accompaniied
by XML metadata for data covered by ESMF metadata conventions,
assuming that the computer architecture supports IEEE 754 Floating
Point Standard. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} XML metadata should be specified. Possibility of BIG
ENDIAN and LITTLE ENDIAN bit ordering should be taken into account.
\end{reqlist}

\req{IO requirements for Unstructured Gridded Data}

\sreq{Reading and Writing HDF-EOS files}

ESMF has to provide interfaces and software to read and write HDF-EOS
files (Point Format) for structured gridded data covered by ESMF metadata 
conventions. 

\begin{reqlist}

{\bf Source:} DAO \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.
\end{reqlist}


\req{Parallel IO Requirements}


\sreq{Single-threaded IO of distribuded data}
