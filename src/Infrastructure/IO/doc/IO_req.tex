\req{General IO Requirements for Gridded Data}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are general requirements for IO operations and are in
addition to the applicable general ESMF requirements (see ESMF General 
Requirements document, section 8.1.3).

\sreq{Determine ESMF convention on Gridded Data}

A set of metadata conventions on gridded data has to be determined
within ESMF. Such convensions will be an extension of the NetCDF 
Climate-Forecast (CF) Metadata Convensions \cite{NetCDF_CF_v1_beta3}.


\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO, NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} ? \\
\end{reqlist}


\sreq{Reading and Writing netCDF files}

ESMF has to provide interface and software to read and write netCDF
files for data covered by ESMF metadata conventions. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO, NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Reading and Writing HDF4 files}

ESMF has to provide interfaces and software to read and write HDF4
files for data covered by ESMF metadata conventions. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO, NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:}
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Reading and Writing HDF5 files}

ESMF has to provide interfaces and software to read and write HDF5
files for data covered by ESMF metadata conventions. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO, NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. 
native HDF5 interface. \\
{\bf Notes:}
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Reading and Writing GRIB files}

ESMF has to provide interfaces and software to read and write GRIB
files for data covered by ESMF metadata conventions. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1 \\
{\bf Source:} NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Although GRIB1 is currently in operational use at NCEP,
it is proposed that ESMF will support GRIB2 format assuming transition
in the next two years.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Reading and Writing Native Binary Files accompanied by metadata}

ESMF has to provide interfaces and software to read and write native
binary files for each machine accompaniied by XML metadata for data
covered by ESMF metadata conventions, assuming that the computer architecture
supports IEEE 754 Floating Point Standard. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} XML metadata should be specified. Possibility of BIG
ENDIAN and LITTLE ENDIAN bit ordering should be taken into account.
\end{reqlist}


\req{General IO requirements for Observational Data}

\sreq{Determine ESMF convention on Observational Data}

A set of metadata conventions on observational data has to be determined
within ESMF.


\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO, NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} ? \\
\end{reqlist}



\sreq{Reading BUFR Files}

ESMF has to provide interfaces and software to read BUFR files for
observational data covered by ESMF metadata convensions.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO, NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Limitations on types of data, etc.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Reading and writing in HDF-EOS Point Format}

ESMF has to provide interfaces and software to read and write
observational data in HDF-EOS Point Format.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Limitations on types of data, etc.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Internal Database Representation of Observational Data}

ESMF has to provide efficient relational database representation of
observational data allowing efficient processing of quiries typical in
the process of data analysis and assimilation.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.
\end{reqlist}

 


\req{Parallel IO Requirements}


\sreq{Single-threaded IO of distribuded data}

ESMF should provide single-treaded IO of distributed data when a
single process acquires all the data from other processors and writes
them to the disk or read data from the disk and pass them to other processes. 


\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Multi-threaded IO of distribuded data to a single file}


ESMF should provide multi-treaded IO of distributed data when each
process reads data from the disk and writes data to the disk. A proper
synchronization mechanism is required. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.
\end{reqlist}


\sreq{Multi-threaded IO of distribuded data to a multiple files}


ESMF should provide multi-treaded IO of distributed data when each
process reads data from and writes data to an independent file. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test.
\end{reqlist}
