\req{General IO Requirements for Gridded Data}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are general requirements for IO operations and are in
addition to the applicable general ESMF requirements (see ESMF General 
Requirements document).




\sreq{Reading and Writing netCDF files}

ESMF has to provide interface and software to read and write netCDF
files for data covered by CF conventions. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO, NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} We have to decide whether netCDF2, or netCDF3 , or both
have to be covered.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Reading and Writing HDF4 files}

ESMF has to provide interfaces and software to read and write HDF4
files for data covered by netCDF CF conventions. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO, NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:}
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Reading and Writing HDF5 files}

ESMF has to provide interfaces and software to read and write HDF5
files for data covered by netCDF CF conventions. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO, NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. 
native HDF5 interface. \\
{\bf Notes:}
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Reading and Writing GRIB files}

ESMF has to provide interfaces and software to read and write GRIB
files for data covered by netCDF CF conventions. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1 \\
{\bf Source:} NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Although GRIB1 is currently in operational use at NCEP,
it is proposed that ESMF will support GRIB2 format assuming transition
in the next two years.
\end{reqlist}

\sreq{Reading and Writing Native Binary Files accompanied by metadata}

ESMF has to provide interfaces and software to read and write native
binary files for each machine accompaniied by XML metadata for data
covered by netCDF CF conventions, assuming that the computer architecture
supports IEEE 754 Floating Point Standard. 

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} XML metadata should be specified. Possibility of BIG
ENDIAN and LITTLE ENDIAN bit ordering should be taken into account.
\end{reqlist}


\req{General IO requirements for Observational Data}

\sreq{Reading BUFR Files}

ESMF has to provide interfaces and software to read BUFR files.

\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO, NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} Limitations on types of data, etc.
\end{reqlist}


\req{IO Performance and Optimization Requirements}

\sreq{Indexing GRIB files}

ESMF has to provide an interface and software to create an index for a GRIB
file allowing fast access to binary data.


\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2 \\
{\bf Source:} NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} performance test. \\
{\bf Notes:} 
\end{reqlist}


\sreq{Optimization of encoding/decoding of BUFR messages}

ESMF has to be able to use multithreading and parallelization in 
encoding/decoding of BUFR messages. 


\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 3 \\
{\bf Source:} NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} 
\end{reqlist}


\sreq{Optimization of physical access to data}

ESMF should provide mechanisms to exploit operational system tools for
optimized parallel physical access to disk files.


\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2 \\
{\bf Source:} DAO, NCEP required \\
{\bf Status:} Proposed \\
{\bf Verification:} Unit test. \\
{\bf Notes:} 
\end{reqlist}
