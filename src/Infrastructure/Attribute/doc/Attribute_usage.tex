This section describes the use of the ESMF Attribute class.  It uses Attribute packages to build an Attribute hierarchy among a complex structure of Components, States, FieldBundles, and Fields.  The creation of standard Attribute packages is shown with respect to the ESG compliant standard that is currently employed by ESMF.  The ability to customize standard Attribute packages, as well as create completely customized packages is also discussed.  The retrieval of default Attributes, the ability to copy an Attribute hierarchy between States, and the options for writing out the contents of an Attribute hierarchy are also discussed.
