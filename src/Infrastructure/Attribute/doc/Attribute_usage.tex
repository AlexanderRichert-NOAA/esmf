This section describes the use of the {\tt ESMF\_Attribute} class.  There are three examples that follow, which outline the use of {\tt Attribute}s at three increasing levels of difficulty.  The first example covers basic {\tt Attribute} manipulations on the gridded Component.  The second example covers the {\tt Attribute} package capabilities, including {\tt Attribute} package nesting and {\tt Attribute} hierarchy linking.  The third example covers {\tt Attribute} management in a distributed environment and the I/O utilities.  These examples will be best understood if followed in an ascending order from basic to advanced.
