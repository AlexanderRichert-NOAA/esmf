The ESMF Attribute class is used to hold the meta-data for other ESMF objects.  This class can be used to build attribute hierarchies for date linking in complex ways.  The attribute class is capable of allowing the representation of {\bf attribute packages} for more unified description of an object.  The attribute class is only partially implemented in this release 

\subsubsection{Attribute Representation in ESMF}

ESMF Attributes are meant to be used as a tool for the user to help internally document their project.   Several ESMF objects are allowed to have attributes associated with them, and some ESMF object have pre-specified attribute packages as well.  The ESMF objects which have attributes are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Array
\item Bundle
\item Field
\item Grid
\item State
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Attribute Hierarchies}

Of these ESMF objects with attributes, only three can link their attribute hierarchies together.  They are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Bundle
\item Field
\item State
\end{itemize}

These ESMF objects can only link their attribute hierarchies to an object that is "bigger" than it is.  For instance, and Bundle can link its attribute hierarchy to a State but not a Field.  On the other hand, a Field is allowed to link its attribute hierarchy to a Bundle.  
%When attribute hierarchies are linked a full deep copy of the attribute hierarchy being linked is made.  Thus any further changes to the original attribute hierarchy will not be reflected in the linked version.

\subsubsection{Attribute Packages}

At this point, all classes that have attribute capabilities also have attribute packages.  The attribute packages are a work in progress in collaboration with the Earth Systems Grid - Community Data Portal (ESG-CDP).  Every attribute package is specified by a {\bf convention} and a {\bf purpose}, such as netCDF and general.  As this capability evolves there will be many more attribute package options for users.
