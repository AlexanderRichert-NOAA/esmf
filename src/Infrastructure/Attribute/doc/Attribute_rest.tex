The ability to update an Attribute hierarchy, including Attribute packages, is an area of active design and development.  The ability to reconcile Attributes is already implemented, as described in Section \ref{sec:Att:Dist}.  It may also be necessary to update any or all of the Attributes in an Attribute hierarchy during runtime, without the expense of calling {\tt ESMF\_StateReconcile()}.  

Additional capabilities which are still in the developmental stage are listed by category.
 
\subsubsection{Attributes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ability to read in meta data automatically from an XML file.
\item Ability to output Attribute data in various formats
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Attribute Hierarchies}

\begin{itemize}
\item Addition of a updating routine that will sync an Attribute hierarchy with a later version of itself.
\item The option of "deep" copies of an Attribute hierarchy
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Attribute Packages}

\begin{itemize}
\item Automatically create object Attribute packages upon object creation.
\item Enforcement of meta data standards
\end{itemize}
