\label{sec:AttPacks}

At this time, all ESMF objects which are enabled to contain Attributes can also contain Attribute packages.  Every Attribute package is specified by a {\bf convention} and a {\bf purpose}, hereafter called {\bf specifiers}, such as "CF" (see below) and "General".  These specifiers are used to validate ESMF Attribute packages against existing metadata conventions.  The user can choose to use an ESMF pre-defined Attribute package, specify their own Attribute package, or add customized Attributes to any of the ESMF pre-defined Attribute packages. Currently, the creation and setting of Attribute packages is quite involved, but future development with IO will allow for a more automated approach to populating Attribute packages from a file.  This is already possible via {\tt ESMF\_AttributeRead()} for the ESMF/ESG/CF Attribute packages supplied by ESMF, as well as for custom individual Attributes not in a package.

The standard Attribute packages supplied by ESMF exist for the following ESMF objects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CplComp
    \item GridComp
    \item State
    \item Field
    \item Grid
    \item Array
\end{itemize}

The packages described in this section are grouped by the ESMF object they apply to. The creation of custom attributes and custom attribute packages is also possible and is discussed in Section X. In some cases it is possible to nest custom packages to ESMF packages. Attribute package nesting is described separately in the following section.  

Some Attributes come with a controlled vocabulary. A controlled vocabulary is a list of options that can be selected as the value of the attribute. The controlled vocabularies listed in this documentation represent those chosen by the community. They are not exhaustive and users may set these Attributes to a different value if they so choose. The primary consequence of doing so is that the resulting output may not be recognized by any of the online tools being developed around this controlled vocabulary.  

\subsubsection{Component Attribute Packages}
\label{ComponentAttributePackages}

There are many attributes that are used to describe components. There are currently 5 predefined component-level Attribute packages:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Earth System Grid (ESG) Basic
    \item Common Information Model (CIM) Main
    \item Common Information Model (CIM) Platform
    \item Common Information Model (CIM) Responsible Party
    \item Common Information Model (CIM) Citation
\end{enumerate}

    \end{itemize}  
    \item Description: The CIM is a formal model of the climate modelling process being developed by the European Union's METAFOR project (http://metaforclimate.eu/). ``It includes descriptions of the experiments being undertaken, the simulations being run in support of these experiments, the software models and tools being used to implement the simulations and the data generated by the software.'' The CIM divides up the climate modeling process into 6 sections. The CIM also contains other standards. It is the primary metadata representation for the fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). ESMF is currently implementing only a subset of the CIM. The representation is expected to grow. The CIM Main Package contains several standalone properties used to describe components. It also serves as the anchor to which other CIM packages are nested. Presently, these additional CIM Packages (described below) can only be created if the CIM Main Package is created. In the future, these packages will be decoupled, so that users may select subsections of the CIM to create and use. Nesting is described in Section \ref{sec: AttPackNesting}. 
    \begin{itemize}
       \item Shared: Contains those elements that are used in many different packages. 
       \item Quality: Contains elements used to express diverse quality metrics for CIM Metadata or for artifacts that the CIM metadata describes.
       \item Grids: Provides a complete description of the horizontal and vertical discretization of modeling elements. This may refer to grids that output data is mapped onto, software adheres to, as well as activity constraints. 
       \item Activity: Specifies the experimental design including the experimental requirements and description of how simulations conform to these requirements.
       \item Software: Specifies all the modeling software components used within the experiment process. 
       \item Data: Describes the data output from the climate modelling process as well as for input data.

\subsubsection{Field Attribute Packages}
\label{FieldAttributePackages}

Several standards exist to describe fields. There are currently 4 predefined Field-level Attribute packages:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Climate Forecast (CF) Convention General
    \item Climate Forecast (CF) Convention Extended
    \item Common Information Model (CIM) Inputs
    \item Earth System Grid General

\end{enumerate}

\vspace{.20in}
{\bf 1. Climate Forecast (CF) Convention General}

    \item Purpose: General
    \item Output Options:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tab-delimited
        \item Simple XML
        \item CIM XML (when part of the CIM package)
    \end{itemize} 
    \item: Description: The climate and forecast (CF) convention contains metadata that is designed to promote the processing and sharing of files created with the NetCDF API. The CF conventions are increasingly gaining acceptance and have been adopted by a number of projects and groups as a primary standard. The conventions define metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data. This enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities. The ESMF CF Attribute package contains the three mandatory Attributes required to describe fields.  
\end{itemize}

\begin{tabular}{|p{8cm}|p{20cm}|p{10cm}|}
    {\bf Name } & {\bf Definition} & {\bf Controlled Vocabulary} \\
    \hline\hline
    {\tt VariableLongName} & An ad-hoc long descriptive name which may, for example, be used for labeling plots & N/A\\
    {\tt VariableShortName}  & The short\_name is technically not part of the CF stanard but is commonly the name of the variable on the output file and so is distinct from the long\_name & N/A \\
    {\tt VariableUnits}  & The value of the units attribute is a string that can be recognized by UNIDATA"s Udunits package & None\\
\end{tabular}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tab-delimited
        \item Simple XML
        \item CIM XML (when part of the CIM package)
    \end{itemize} 
    \item The CF standard for fields contains an optional standard\_name Attribute. Standard names are controlled vocabularies and not every variable in the earth system sciences contains a standard name. Because of this, ESMF implemented this optional Attribute in its own package.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tabular}{|p{8cm}|p{20cm}|p{10cm}|}
    {\bf Name } & {\bf Definition} & {\bf Controlled Vocabulary} \\

It is also used to describe any ancillary data sets that contain input condition variables. This package should not be used to describe the variables in an unconfigured model component. A pre-defined Attribute package for that case will be implemented in a future release of ESMF.    
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Custom Attribute Packages}
\label{CustomAttPacks}

ESMF allows for the creation of custom attribute packages. This can be done to augment one of the pre-defined packages (via package nesting \ref{sec:AttPackNesting}) or to create a suite of 
attributes unique to the user. Example of how to create a custom package are contained in Section XX (link to the proposed custom att pack example)
