\subsubsection {What is Nesting of Attribute Packages}


Nesting is a way of creating larger packages out of smaller ones and allows users to pick and chose the attributes they want. It is very useful when combining a custom package with a pre-defined package. Nesting is possible as both a single-child nest or a multiple-child nest. Breaking Attributes up into smaller packages that are then nested also allows for the construction of complex attribute trees where certain structures repeat themselves.  


Several of the ESMF pre-defined packages come pre-nested:

CIM Main should be nested with:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item CIM Platform
   \item CIM Responsible Party
   \item CIM Citation
\end{enumerate}

CF Extended should be nested with:

\begin{enumerate}
   \item CF General
\end{enumerate}

An explanation of the specifiers is in order at this point.  The purpose 
specifier is really just meant as an additional means, beyond the use of 
"convention", to specify Attribute packages.  One could imagine that the 
CF convention would want to be able to have Attribute packages divided 
up in some fashion, which ESMF could then keep track of with the purpose 
specifier.  It was added with the intention of allowing Attributes, and 
packages, maximum flexibility.  Take the Field's ESMF standard Attribute 
package for example.  This 
package is made up of three nested Attribute packages.  The lowest one 
is made up of three Attributes with convention=CF and purpose=General.  
The next level contains one Attribute with convention=CF but 
purpose=Extended.  On top of this is the convention=ESG package, also 
with purpose=General.
