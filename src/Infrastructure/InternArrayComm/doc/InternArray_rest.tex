%\subsection{Restrictions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf 7D limit.}  Scalars and ranks up to 7D (the Fortran limit) are 
supported.

\item {\bf Halo space created on all axes.}
When the {\tt haloWidth} argument is specifed extra space is allocated
on all axes, even if only a subset of the axes correspond to Grid axes 
and actually require halo space.

\item {\bf Name cannot be specifed at Create time.}
The current interfaces do not allow the Array name to be set at
create time. Until this oversight is fixed use 
{\tt ESMF\_ArraySet()} on the existing array to set the name.

\item {\bf Arrays of derived types not supported.}  Arrays of derived 
types will not be directly supported by the framework.
However, non-contiguous arrays which can be defined by (start/end/stride)
triplets will be, so the user can construct a buffer by using a derived
type and then define it as individual data arrays or a packed bundle array.

\end{enumerate}
