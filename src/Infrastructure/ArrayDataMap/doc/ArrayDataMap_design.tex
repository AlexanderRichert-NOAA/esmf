%\subsection{Design}

The Array DataMap class maintains information about the way an ESMF Array
object maps to the associated Grid in a Field object.  The Array class
maintains the linearization of multidimensional data to memory addresses,
but the Array DataMap class maintains the mapping between rank numbers and
Grid axes.

The Array DataMap class implements methods for reordering or repacking
memory which can be transparent to the calling code.  None of the
methods in the DataMap class change data values; they simply
change the mapping to memory addresses.
