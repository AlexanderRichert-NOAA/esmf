%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Support is limited to 2D, logically rectangular grids.} 
Currently the only interfaces supported are for two-dimensional, 
logically rectangular grids. 

\item {\bf Support is limited to 2D grid distributions.} The 
decomposition of grids is limited to two dimensions.

\item {\bf No Grid read method.} Currently it is not possible to 
create a Grid by reading in a specification from a file.

\end{enumerate}
