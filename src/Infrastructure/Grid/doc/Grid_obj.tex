\subsection{Object Model}

The following is a simplified UML diagram showing the structure of the
Grid class.  See Appendix A, {\it A Brief Introduction to UML},
for a translation table that lists the symbols in the diagram and their 
meaning.

Each Grid contains a Distributed Grid and a Physical Grid. The Physical Grid
maintains information about the global coordinates. In general this data is
described implicitly by specifying the grid type and the corresponding
parameters. However it is possible that the Physical Grid must be completely
enumerated, perhaps in the case of assimilated data or unstructured data. The
Distributed Grid defines an index space that corresponds to cells in 
the Physical
Grid and is decomposed among DEs in a DELayout.
