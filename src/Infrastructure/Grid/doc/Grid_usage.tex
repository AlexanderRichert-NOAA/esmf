%\subsection{Design and Implementation Notes}


In typical applications, Grids are created either internally or read in from
a file.  The ESMF\_Grid class provides methods for both.  It also has a variety
of methods to set and get Grid parameters like the number of cells on any
particular processor.  Some methods which have a Grid interface are actually
implemented at the underlying DistGrid or PhysGrid level; they will be inherited
by the Grid class.  This allows the API to present functions at the level which
is most consistent to the application without restricting where inside the ESMF
the actual implementation is done.
