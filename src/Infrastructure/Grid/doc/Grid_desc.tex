Each Grid contains a Distributed Grid and a Physical Grid. The Physical Grid
maintains information about the global coordinates. In general this data is
described implicitly by specifying the grid type and the corresponding
parameters. However it is possible that the Physical Grid must be completely
enumerated, perhaps in the case of assimilated data or unstructured data. The
Distributed Grid defines an index space that corresponds to cells in the Physical Grid and is decomposed among DEs in a DELayout.
