% <Describe class function and relation to other classes.>

The ESMF Grid class represents the computational domain and its
decomposition in a parallel-processing environment.  The ESFM Grid class
is aggregated into the Field class and/or the Gridded Component class
and provides communication capabilities to those classes like halo and
redistribution.  It has methods to internally generate a variety of
simple grids or read in more complicated grids provided by a user.  The
ESMF Grid class supports multi-component coupling by providing a common
structure necessary for Regridding.

\subsection{Grid Classes}
The Grid class aggregates two internal classes: the DistGrid (Distributed
Grid) class and the PhysGrid (Physical Grid) class.  The separation into two
classes allows the code to differentiate between functions which define the
local decomposition of data and the local representation of the grid.  The Grid
class itself maintains general information about the global grid (e.g. the
grid type, staggering, and coordinate system).  The Grid class is relatively
thin and otherwise presents a unified interface for DistGrid and PhysGrid
functions.  Each Grid contains at least one DistGrid and one PhysGrid:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf DistGrid} The DistGrid class maintains the relationship of how
a DELayout maps onto a Grid representation and how that Grid is distributed.
DistGrids can represent the same Grid but have different mappings (staggerings)
and can be aggregated by the same Grid object. The DistGrid class maintains the
mapping between the global Grid and the local data distribution;  it has
methods to aid in the collection and communication of global data.
\item {\bf PhysGrid} The PhysGrid class maintains a local physical
representation of a Grid, including all necessary data and masks.  PhysGrids
can represent subGrids, like vertical Grids, of a single Grid and be
aggregated by the same Grid object.
