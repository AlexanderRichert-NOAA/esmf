% <Describe class function and relation to other classes.>

The ESMF Grid class represents all aspects of the computational domain and its
decomposition in a parallel-processing environment, and must provide access to
any necessary grid information to the rest of the ESMF.  The ESMF Grid class
is included in the Field class and the Gridded Component class
and provides information needed in data communication methods like halo and
redistribution.  It has methods to internally generate a variety of
simple grids or read in more complicated grids provided by a user.  The
ESMF Grid class supports multi-component coupling by providing a common
structure necessary for regridding.

A single Grid can have more than one related subGrid.  Each subGrid corresponds
to a different representation of the Grid.  For example, a staggered Grid could
have separate subGrids representing locations at the cell centers and cell 
faces.  A vertical grid may also be represented as a subGrid.
