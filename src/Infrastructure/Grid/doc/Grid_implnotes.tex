%\subsection{Design and Implementation Notes}

Each Grid contains at least one Distributed Grid and one Physical Grid.  
The separation into two internal classes allows the code to differentiate
between functions which define the local decomposition of data and
the local representation of the grid.  The Grid class itself maintains
general information about the global grid (e.g. the grid type, staggering,
and coordinate system).  The Grid class is relatively thin and
otherwise presents a unified interface for DistGrid and PhysGrid
functions.

The Grid class contains all information about the computational grid
for a Component, and must provide access to any necessary grid information
to the rest of the ESMF.  A single Grid can have more than one related
DistGrid and PhysGrid set, called a SubGrid.  Each SubGrid corresponds to
a different representation of the Grid.  For example, a staggered Grid could
have separate subGrids representing cell centers and cell vertices.  A
vertical grid may also be represented as a SubGrid.

Some methods which have a Grid interface are actually implemented
at the underlying DistGrid or PhysGrid level; they will be inherited
by the Grid class.  This allows the API to present functions at the 
level which is most consistent
to the application without restricting where inside the ESMF the actual
implementation is done.
