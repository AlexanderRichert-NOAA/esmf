 \subsubsection{ESMF\_CoordOrder}

 {\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}
 The Grid class can be set to different default ordering of coordinates, for
 example KIJ.  This sets the default coordinate ordering for all Fields created
 from the Grid as well (although there is also a way to override this default
 with a user-specified mapping between rank numbers in the Field and Grid
 during Field creation -- please see the Field section for details).  This
 feature is designed to provide the user with an simple mechanism to change
 the overall ordering of indices.  This parameter describes ordering options
 supported by ESMF.

 Valid values are:
 \begin{description}
    \item [ESMF\_COORD\_ORDER\_UNKNOWN]
          Unknown or undefined coordinate ordering.

    \item [ESMF\_COORD\_ORDER\_XYZ]
          The coordinates are ordered XYZ.  This is equivalent to IJK ordering.
          For a 2D grid, this defaults to IJ mapping.

    \item [ESMF\_COORD\_ORDER\_XZY]
          The coordinates are ordered XZY.  For a 2D grid, this defaults to IJ 
          mapping to XY.

    \item [ESMF\_COORD\_ORDER\_YXZ]
          The coordinates are ordered YXZ.  For a 2D grid, this defaults to IJ
          mapping to YX.

    \item [ESMF\_COORD\_ORDER\_YZX]
          The coordinates are ordered YZX.  For a 2D grid, this defaults to IJ
          mapping to YX.

    \item [ESMF\_COORD\_ORDER\_ZXY]
          The coordinates are ordered ZXY.  For a 2D grid, this defaults to IJ
          mapping to XY.

    \item [ESMF\_COORD\_ORDER\_ZYX]
          The coordinates are ordered ZYX.  For a 2D grid, this defaults to IJ
          mapping to YX.
