\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}
\label{XGrid:rest}

\item {\bf CAUTION:} The XGrid class currently does not support merging of two global Grids. This is expected to be supported in a future release.
\item {\bf CAUTION:} The XGrid class currently does not support masking. This is expected to be supported in a future release.
\item {\bf CAUTION:} Any Grid pair picked from the A side and B side of the XGrid cannot be topologically and geometrically identical on a local PET. This is expected to
be relaxed in a future release. 

\end{enumerate}
