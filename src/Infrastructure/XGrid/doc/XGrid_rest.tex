\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}
\label{XGrid:rest}

\item {\bf CAUTION:} The XGrid class and its APIs are only tested in a 
uni-processor setup, however in principle it should also work multi-processor. 
This limitation will be removed in a future release.
\item More convenient {\tt ESMF\_XGridCreate()} API will be provided in
the future that will not require a user to supply the interpolation matrix.

\end{enumerate}
