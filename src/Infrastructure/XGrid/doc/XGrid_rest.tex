\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}
\label{XGrid:rest}

\item {\bf CAUTION:} The XGrid class and its APIs are only tested in a 
uni-processor setup, however in principle it should also work multi-processor. 
This limitation will be removed in a future release.

\end{enumerate}
