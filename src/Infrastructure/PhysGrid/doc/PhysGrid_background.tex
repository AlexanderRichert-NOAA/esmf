\section{Background}

  The ESMF Physical Grid facility (PhysGrid) describes the physical location of
data and of all the points on a grid. In addition, PhysGrid provides an
extensive range of metric terms (e.g. grid spacings and areas) associated with
a grid.  Grid masks are generated through PhysGrid.

\subsection{Location}

  PhysGrid is a part of the "Fields and Grids" portion of the infrastructure.
PhysGrid interacts closely with the index spaces in the Distributed Grid
facility (DistGrid); the creation of a DistGrid precedes the creation of a
PhysGrid.  Most Fields exist at locations described via PhysGrid.  Regrid uses
PhysGrid information.

\subsection{Scope}

PhysGrid does not cover domain decomposition or specification of grid
topology; these are covered by DistGrid.
