The BundleDataMap class specifies how the Fields within a packed Bundle are 
interleaved.  In a packed Bundle, the data arrays of constituent 
Fields have been copied or transferred to a single combined data array.  
This is generally done for optimization - either to increase data 
locality for quick data retrieval from memory or to aggregate 
communications to reduce latency.  

Packed Bundles are not fully implemented.  Currently the Field data 
within Bundles are always stored as individual data references.  
At this point the BundleDataMap class is a placeholder; values for 
a Bundle interleave flag can be set and retrieved, but they are not used 
by the framework.
