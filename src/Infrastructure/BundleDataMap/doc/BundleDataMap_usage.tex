%\subsection{Use and Examples}

A BundleDataMap is a shallow object.  It can simply be declared 
as a local (stack) variable, and does not have
to be created or destroyed.  To initialize a BundleDataMap with default
values a set default method is provided.  To alter or query an existing
object, use the set and get methods.  A print method is provided
for human-readable output or debugging.
