%\subsection{Use and Examples}

A BundleDataMap is a shallow object.  It can simply be declared 
as a local (stack) variable in a subroutine, and does not have
to be created or destroyed.  To initialize the object with default
values a setdefault method is provided.  To alter or query an existing
object, use the set and get methods.  A print method is provided
for human readable output or debugging.
