%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Threading turned off.}  The multi-threading features of VM 
are currently disabled in order to prevent conflicts with those 
parts of ESMF that are not thread-safe.

\item {\bf Concurrency support turned off.}  The concurrency features of 
VM are currently disabled. 

\item {\bf Nonblocking versions not implemented.}  Only the blocking 
versions of the communication primitives are currently implemented.

\item {\bf {\tt ESMF\_SUM} is the only reduction operation 
currently implemented.} 

\item {\bf None of the topology features have been implemented.}

\end{enumerate}
