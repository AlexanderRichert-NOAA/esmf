%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item The multi--threading features of VM are currently disabled in order to prevent conflicts with those parts of ESMF that are not thread--safe.

\item The concurrency features of VM are currently disabled in order to lower the callback overhead into top component methods. 

\item Only the blocking versions of the communication primitives are currently implemented.

\item None of the topology features have been implemented.

\end{enumerate}
