\subsubsection{ESMF\_BlockingFlag}

{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}
General ESMF flag indicating blocking or non-blocking behavior.

Valid values are:
\begin{description}
   \item [ESMF\_BLOCKING]
         The called method will block until all (PET-)local operations are 
         complete. After the return of a blocking method it is safe to modify
         or use all participating local data.
   \item [ESMF\_NONBLOCKING]
         The called method will not block but return immediately after
         initiating the requested operation. It is unsafe to modify
         or use participating local data after the return of a non-blocking
         method and before the associated {\tt ESMF\_Wait} call.
\end{description}
