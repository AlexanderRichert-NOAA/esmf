\subsubsection{ESMF\_BlockingFlag}

{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}
General ESMF flag indicating blocking or non-blocking behavior.

Valid values are:
\begin{description}
   \item [{\tt ESMF\_BLOCKING}]
         The called method will block until all (PET-)local operations are 
         complete. After the return of a blocking method it is safe to modify
         or use all participating local data.
   \item [{\tt ESMF\_NONBLOCKING}]
         The called method will not block but return immediately after
         initiating the requested operation. It is unsafe to modify
         or use participating local data before all local operations have     
         completed.
\end{description}
