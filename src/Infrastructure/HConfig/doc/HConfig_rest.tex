%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item The JSON schema is implemented and used to resolve non-specific tags.
  There is currently no mechanism implemented to switch to a different schema
  for tag resolution.
\item Currently the only available removal method for HConfig {\em map}
  objects requires that {\em keys} be simple scalar strings.
\item There is currently no method implemented to set or modify tags.
\end{itemize}
