%\subsection{Description}

Halo operations update ghost-cell or halo regions at the boundaries
of a local data decomposition.  Halo regions are to be considered
read-only by the local process; their data values can be used to
compute the new values for cells which are local to this process,
but they cannot be updated except by a Halo operation.
