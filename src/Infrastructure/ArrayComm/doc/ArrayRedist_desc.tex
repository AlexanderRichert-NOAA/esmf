Redistribution operations always operate on data associated with a
single Grid, but are either decomposed across multiple DEs
differently, or have different index orderings, or are decomposed
in different dimensions.  The Redistribution methods involve only
data movement; no interpolation, data binning, or averaging is
performed.  A typical example of redistribution is the data transpose
associated with the translation between physical and Fourier space.
