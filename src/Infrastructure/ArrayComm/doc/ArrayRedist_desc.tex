Redistribution operations always operate on data associated with a
single Grid, but are either decomposed across multiple DEs
differently, or have different index orderings, or are decomposed
in different dimensions.  The Redistribution methods involve only
data movement; no interpolation, data binning, or averaging is
performed.  A typical example of redistribution is the data transpose
associated with the translation between physical and Fourier space.

An example of the use of ESMF redistribution methods is presented in
the FieldRedist system test.
