Redistribution operations always operate on data associated with a
single Grid, but are either decomposed across multiple processors
differently, or have different index orderings, or are decomposed
in different dimensions.  The Redistribution methods involve only
data movement; no interpolation, data binning, averaging, etc are
performed.  A typical example of Redistribution is the data transpose
associated with the translation between phycial and Fourier space.

An example of the use of ESMF Redistribution methods is presented in
the FieldRedist system test.

In the future, we plan to have specific interfaces for common uses
like the data transpose.
