%\subsection{Description}

Redistribution operations always operate on data associated with a
single Grid, but are either decomposed across multiple processors
differently, or have different index orderings, or are decomposed
in different dimensions.  The Redistribution methods involve only
data movement; no interpolation, data binning, averaging, etc are
performed.
