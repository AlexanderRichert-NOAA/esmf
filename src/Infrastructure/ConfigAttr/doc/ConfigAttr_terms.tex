\item [NAMELIST] \label{glos:nml} An I/O feature supported by Fortran that
defines a structured syntax for creating text files of initial variable
settings and defines language features for compactly reading the files.
Most ESMF codes use the NAMELIST features in Fortan, but the feature
has several deficiencies and limited capabilities. The ESMF 
{\bf configuration attributes} facility addresses these deficiencies 
and limitations. The syntax for NAMELIST files can be found
in most Fortran manuals and tutorial texts.
