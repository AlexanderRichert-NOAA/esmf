\section{Background}

Many applications in Earth system modeling require
communicating fields between different grids.  Such
cases occur when coupling two models that utilize
different grids (eg coupling atmosphere and ocean
components of a climate model) or when a single model
utilizes more than one grid (eg nested grids or multi-grid).
Fields must then be interpolated or remapped
from one grid to another.  We will refer to this process
as {\em regridding}. Many different methods
for performing regriddings are required.
Regridding heat or water fluxes between models requires
fluxes to be regridded in a way that conserves
the total energy or water flux in the model.  In other
cases, it is more important that higher-order
regridding methods be used to prevent discontinuities
in the interpolated fields or their gradients.

In addition to moving fields between grids,
models require moving ungridded data (eg observations)
to and from model grids.  Transforming fields
from physical space to spectral space is also
a frequent operation.

The ESMF Regridding facility (Regrid) will
supply necessary functions and data structures for
{\em quality} implementations of {\em bespoken} regridding
operations.  Appropriate functions for all supported
ESMF grids will be supplied.

\subsection{Location}

The regridding and interpolation is part of the ESMF
Infrastructure.  It will use information from Physical
Grids (PhysGrid) to compute regridding information and
use Distributed Grid (DistGrid) for performing
data-motion related to regridding.  It will (presumably)
be used by couplers(?) and fields (?).

\subsection{Scope}

ESMF Regrid is meant to be used for mapping data
between ESMF grids.  It is not meant to be a data
assimilation system.
