%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Support is limited to 1D and 2D regridding.}  Regridding
support is limited to two dimensions.

\item {\bf Masks are not implemented.}  Regridding methods take
masks in their argument lists, but they currently have no effect.

\item {\bf Regridding only fills computational domains.}  Currently,
regridded values are not automatically applied to halo regions.
Users must manually call Halo after regridding in order to do so.

\item {\bf Special pole treatment is not implemented.}
Conservative regridding methods do not yet have the special pole
treatment completed.

\item {\bf Interpolation weights are not available to users.}  
Currently, there is no method to allow users access to the interpolation
weights for any desired manipulations.

\item {\bf Spherical coordinates are not shifted.}
 Regrid methods do not yet shift longitude coordinates
(or their equivalent) from the source Grid to place them on the same
360 degree (or 2*pi) range as the destination Grid. 

\item {\bf Future regrid methods.}  The following methods will
be added:
 \begin{description}
   \item [ESMF\_REGRID\_METHOD\_ADJOINT]
         Create adjoint of existing regrid
   \item [ESMF\_REGRID\_METHOD\_FILE]
         Read a regrid from a file
   \item [ESMF\_REGRID\_METHOD\_FOURIER]
         Fourier transform
   \item [ESMF\_REGRID\_METHOD\_INDEX]
         Index-space regrid (shift, stencil)
   \item [ESMF\_REGRID\_METHOD\_LEGENDRE]
         Legendre transform
   \item [ESMF\_REGRID\_METHOD\_NEARNBR]
         Nearest-neighbor dist-weighted avg
   \item [ESMF\_REGRID\_METHOD\_RASTER]
         Regrid by rasterizing domain
   \item [ESMF\_REGRID\_METHOD\_REGRIDCOPY]
         Copy existing regrid
   \item [ESMF\_REGRID\_METHOD\_SHIFT]
         Shift addresses of existing regrid
   \item [ESMF\_REGRID\_METHOD\_SPLINE]
         Cubic spline for 1-d regridding
   \item [ESMF\_REGRID\_METHOD\_USER]
         User-supplied method
  \end{description}

\end{enumerate}
