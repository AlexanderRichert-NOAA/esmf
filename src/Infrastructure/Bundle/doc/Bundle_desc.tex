% <Describe class function and relation to other classes.>

The Bundle class aggregates the Grid class, the Field class,
and the IOSpec class.
To aggregate multiple Fields, the
instances of Field objects must share the same or an 
equivalent underlying Grid object.  It can optionally
also aggregate the Array class for packed Bundle data.
