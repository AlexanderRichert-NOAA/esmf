The Bundle class represents ``bundles'' of Fields that are 
discretized on the same Grid.  Fields within the same Bundle 
may be located at different locations relative to the vertices of
their common Grid.  Bundles also include an IOSpec clsss that 
contains a collective IO specification for the Fields within 
each Bundle.

In ESMF, Bundles can be packed.  Packing means that the data from all the
Fields that comprise the Bundle are copied into a single Array.  
This operation is done without destroying the original Field 
data.  Packing is useful for performing efficient regridding and 
data communication operations.  All the Fields within a Bundle 
can be regridded at once, rather than regridding each Field 
separately.  Collective data operations can be performed on all the
Fields within a Bundle, rather than having to make separate 
communication calls for each Field.  This reduces the latency overhead
of the communication.
