bundle contains an array in which all the data in its 
constituent Fields is packed contiguously.  Bundles that
are not packed contain Fields whose data may be stored
noncontiguously.

Valid values are:
\begin{description}
   \item [ESMF\_PACKED\_DATA] 
         Contains a packed array.
   \item [ESMF\_NO\_PACKED\_DATA]
         Does not contain a packed array.
\end{description}
