%\subsection{Use and Examples}

Examples of creating, destroying and accessing Bundles and their
constituent Fields are provided in this section, along with some
notes on Bundle methods.

\subsubsection{Bundle Creation}

After creating multiple Fields, a Bundle that can contains them 
can be created by passing a list of the Fields into the 
method {\tt ESMF\_BundleCreate()}.  The Bundle references the 
data buffers of its constituent Fields.  

\subsubsection{Accessing Bundle Data}

To access data in a Bundle, the user can provide a Field
name and retrieve the Field's Fortran data pointer.  Alternatively,
the user can retrieve the data in the form of an ESMF 
Field and use the Field-level interfaces.

\subsubsection{Bundle Deletion}

The user must call {\tt ESMF\_BundleDestroy()} before 
deleting any of its constituent Fields.
