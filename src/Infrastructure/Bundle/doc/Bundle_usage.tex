%\subsection{Use and Examples}

Examples of creating, destroying and accessing Bundles and their
constituent Fields are provided in this section, along with some
notes on Bundle methods.

\subsubsection{Bundle Creation}

After creating multiple Fields, a Bundle
can be created by passing a list of the Fields into the 
method {\tt ESMF\_BundleCreate()}.  The Bundle will contain
references to the Fields.  An empty Bundle can also be created
and Fields added singularly or in groups. 

The feature which requests a packed Array be created from the
combined Field data arrays is not implemented in this version
of the framework.

\subsubsection{Accessing Bundle Data}

To access data in a Bundle the user can provide a Field
name and retrieve the Field's Fortran data pointer.  Alternatively,
the user can retrieve the data in the form of an ESMF 
Field and use the Field-level interfaces.

The packed Array feature of Bundles is not implemented in
this version of the Framework.

\subsubsection{Bundle Deletion}

The user must call {\tt ESMF\_BundleDestroy()} before 
deleting any of the Fields it contains.  Because Fields
can be shared by multiple Bundles and States, they are
not deleted by this call.
