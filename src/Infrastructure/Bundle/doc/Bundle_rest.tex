%\subsubsection{Restrictions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item The Bundle class does not support differential or other
mathematical operators.

\item It also does not automatically support collective field operations,
other than a limited set including I/O, regridding, and subsetting.
For other operations on Fields, first query the Bundle for the
specific field desired, then operate on it with Field methods.

\end{enumerate}
