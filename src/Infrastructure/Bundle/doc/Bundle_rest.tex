%\subsubsection{Restrictions}

% <List class restrictions due to design or implementation strategies.>

The Bundle class will not support advanced
operations on fields, such as differential or other
mathematical operators.

It will also not automatically support collective field operations,
other than a limited set including I/O, regridding, and subsetting.
For other operations on Fields, 
first query the Bundle for the
specific field desired, then operate on it with methods
at the Fields class level.
