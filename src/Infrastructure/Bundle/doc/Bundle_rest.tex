%\subsubsection{Restrictions}

\subsubsection{No Mathematical Operators}
The Bundle class does not support differential or other
mathematical operators.

\subsubsection{Limited Collective Field Operations}
The Bundle class does not automatically support collective field 
operations, other than a limited set including I/O, regridding, and 
indexing.  For other operations on Fields, first query the Bundle 
for the specific Field desired, then operate on it with Field methods.
