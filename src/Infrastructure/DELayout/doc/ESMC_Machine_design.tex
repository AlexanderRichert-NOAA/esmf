The Machine class is designed to isolate and encapsulate system-dependent
information and functions other than for communication (see Comm class).
It provides an API to retrieve information such as the number of nodes,
number CPUs per node, IDs of particular hardware elements (PEs, nodes),
whether the machine provides MPI, pthreads and other communication services,
and various machine performance parameters such as bandwidths, latencies,
cache sizes, and FLOPS.
