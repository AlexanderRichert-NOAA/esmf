%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Virtual DE capabilities not to be used.}
Only 1-to-1 DELayouts are supported by other parts of the ESMF library.

\item {\bf Logically rectangular DELayouts only.}
Only the logical rectangular DELayout creation method is currently implemented.

\item {\bf Computational weights are not yet implemented.}
This is anticipated in the near term.

\item {\bf Load balancing functionality is not yet implemented.}
This capability will be implemented along with compuatational weights per DE.

\end{enumerate}
