\subsubsection{ESMF\_Pin\_Flag}

\label{opt:depinflag}
{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}
Specifies which VM resource DEs are pinned to - i.e. PETs or VASs.

Valid values are:
\begin{description}
  \item [ESMF\_PIN\_DE\_TO\_PET] 
    Pin DEs against PETs. This means that even if a group of PETs in the 
    VM are sharing a common virtual address space (VAS), DEs cannot
    be shared between PETs, but must be serviced by the specific PET they
    are pinned to.
  \item [ESMF\_PIN\_DE\_TO\_VAS]
    Pin DEs against VASs. DEs may be serviced by any PET that is 
    executing within the virtual address space (VAS) the DE is pinned to.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{ESMF\_ServiceReply}

\label{const:servicereply_flag}
{\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}
Reply when a PET offers to service a DE.

Valid values are:
\begin{description}
  \item [ESMF\_SERVICEREPLY\_ACCEPT] 
    The service offer has been accepted. The PET is expected to service the DE.
  \item [ESMF\_SERVICEREPLY\_DENY]
    The service offer has been denied. The PET is expected to not service the
    DE.
\end{description}
