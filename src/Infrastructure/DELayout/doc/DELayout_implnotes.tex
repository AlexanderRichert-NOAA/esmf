%\subsection{Design and Implementation Notes}

The DELayout class stores information about the DEs and their connectivity, thus holding an abstraction of the computational problem. Furthermore a DELayout object holds DE-to-PET mapping info, which maps {\it every} DE to {\it exactly one} PET of the underlying VM. The DELayout is associated with the VM of the context in which the DELayout was created.
