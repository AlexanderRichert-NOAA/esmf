The PE class encapsulates machine dependent identifying information about
a processing element, such as cpu ID and node ID.  A machine-indendent ESMF ID
is also assigned.  A PE is instantiated within a DE upon startup and self-
discovers its cpu and node IDs.  This information from all DE's is then
gathered to form the PE list.
