%\subsection{Description}

A Gridded Component is a shell that holds the code 
does the actual model computation.  Gridded 
Components can run sequentially or concurrently, on all processors 
or on a subset of processors. 

Conceptually simplest is a sequential Component which is called
once per time step, receives 
gridded data from the Input State, computes new values, runs
until the requested stop time, and returns the output 
gridded data in the Output State.  

Combinations of sequential and concurrent behavior are possible,
for example a sequential component which contains concurrent
subcomponents.
