%\subsection{Description}

In Earth system modeling, the simplest way to think of an 
ESMF Gridded Component is as a piece of code representing a 
specific physical domain; for example, an atmospheric model 
or an ocean model.  In many large modeling systems, each 
component is developed separately by a group of domain experts.  
These Earth system software components tend to share a number of 
basic features.  Most contain a variety of physical fields; 
are associated with a (possibly noncontiguous) 
spatial region and grid that is partitioned across a set of 
computational resources; and require a clock, usually for stepping 
a governing set of PDEs forward in time.  Most can also 
be divided into distinct initialize, run, and finalize 
computational phases.  These common characteristics are used 
within ESMF to define a Gridded Component data structure that 
is both tailored for Earth system modeling and yet is still 
quite flexible.

More broadly, an ESMF Gridded Component can be based on any 
software with a computational function that is associated with 
a grid.  This might be a convection or radiation scheme, a 
dynamical core, or a data assimilation system.  ESMF allows you
to nest Gridded Components, so that the physics and dynamics within 
an atmospheric model can be considered Gridded Components, along
with the atmospheric model itself.

An ESMF Gridded Component has two parts.  The first part is the
user code that will form the body of the Gridded Component.
It may be a piece of legacy code, or it may be developed expressly
for use with the ESMF system.  The second part is the ESMF Gridded 
Component derived type itself, {\tt ESMF_GridComp}.
