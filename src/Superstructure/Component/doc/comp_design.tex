%\subsection{Design}

The Component class defines a small set of methods (subroutines) which
will be called by higher level code and must be provided by the user.
It uses instances of the State class to identify the data which is
to be exchanged between separate Components.  It uses the Time class
to describe the current model time, timesteps, and time intervals.


There are three subtypes of the Component class.  An Application
Component contains other Component subobjects, and may either be
the main program, or itself a Component nested in a higher level
Application.  A Gridded Component is a computational entity which
consumes and produces data.  A Coupler Component manages the
transformation of data between Components.
