%\section{Required Methods}

All ESMF Components are required to provide a public subroutine
which is identified as the {\tt SetServices} routine for that Component.
See Sections \ref{sec:GridSetServ} and \ref{sec:CplSetServ}.
It is expected that an Initialize, Run, and Finalize routine will
also be provided by each Component.
