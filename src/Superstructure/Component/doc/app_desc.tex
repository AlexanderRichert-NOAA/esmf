%\subsection{Description}

An Application Component contains other Components which
cooperate in a computation. An Application Component can 
either be a main (top level) program, or it can be a
Component nested in a higher level Application. 

An Application written to follow the Component interface
can be run standalone with a generic driver program which creates
the Component and calls the Init, Run, and Finalize methods.
