%\subsection{Use and Examples}

A Science Component is a container object intended to represent scientific
domains, or realms, in an Earth Science Model.  It's primary purpose is to 
provide the ability to represent an entire component hierarchy without the
overhead of requiring each component to provide executable code.  This 
supports the ability to define metadata (via Attributes) for all components 
while maintaining a low overhead.

An example of how to create Science Components and attached Attributes can
be found in the directory {\tt esmf/src/Superstructure/AttributeAPI/examples}.
