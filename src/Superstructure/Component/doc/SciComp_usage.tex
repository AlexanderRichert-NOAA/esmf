%\subsection{Use and Examples}

A Science Component is a container object intended to represent scientific
domains, or realms, in an Earth Science Model.  It's primary purpose is to 
provide a means for representing Component metadata within a hierarchy of
Components, and it does this by being a container for Attributes as well 
as other Components.

An example of how to create Science Components and attached Attributes can
be found in the directory {\tt esmf/src/Superstructure/Component/examples}.
