%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Gridded Components must only communicate with other
components via data in State objects.  They must 
not make direct references to data in other States.

\item If possible, Gridded Components should attempt to make 
all data private, so public names do not interfere with data 
in other components.

\item It is not expected that a single Gridded Component be able 
to function in both sequential and concurrent modes, although 
Gridded Components of different types can be nested. For example,
a concurrently called Gridded Component can contain several nested 
sequential Gridded Components.
