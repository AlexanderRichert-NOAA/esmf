%\subsection{Description}

A {\bf Component}
is the highest level object in the ESMF object
hierarchy.  Components consist of user supplied code
which follows certain conventions defined by the ESMF framework.
Components must provide a set of subroutines which match ESMF
defined interfaces. They must encapsulate
all their input and output data in an ESMF {\tt State} object.  They
must able to interpret an ESMF {\tt Time} object in order
to execute the requested number of model timesteps or time interval
before exchanging data with other Components.

Components are identified as being one or more of the
following subtypes: {\bf Application}, {\bf Gridded}, or {\bf Coupler}.
An Application Component contains other Components which
cooperate in a computation. An Application Component can also itself be a
Component nested in a higher level Application.  A Gridded Component
does the actual model computation.  A Coupler Component executes or
arranges the execution of the necessary data transformations between one
or more Gridded Components.
