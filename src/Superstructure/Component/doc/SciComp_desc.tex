%\subsection{Description}
\label{sec:SciComp}

In Earth system modeling, a particular piece of code representing a physical 
domain, such as an atmospheric model or an ocean model, is typically 
implemented as an ESMF Gridded Component, or {\tt ESMC\_GridComp}.  
However, there are times when physical domains, or realms, need to be 
represented, but aren't actual pieces of code, or software.  These domains 
cam be implmentd as ESMF Science Components, or {\tt ESMC\_SciComp}.

Unlike Gridded and Coupler Components, Science Components are not associated 
with software, so they don't require the overhead of handling execution 
routines, such as initialize, run and finalize.  Instead, a Science Component 
is a simple container object, that contains basic information, such as name,
as well as lists of other objects, such as Attributes.  In addition, Science
Components can contain other Components, so they can be nested within a
Component hierarchy.
