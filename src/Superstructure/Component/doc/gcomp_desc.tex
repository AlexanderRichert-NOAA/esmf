%\subsection{Description}

A Gridded Component does the actual model computation.
Gridded Components can run sequentially or concurrently, on all
processors or a subset of processors. 

Conceptually simplest is a sequential Component which is called
once per time step, receives 
gridded data from the Input State, computes new values, runs
until the requested stop time, and returns the output 
gridded data in the Output State.  

A concurrent Component takes a Transform as input, and runs
until the stop time.  When data communication is needed, the
Transform routine is called.  In both cases, all data being
communiated between Gridded Components goes thru a State object.

Combinations of sequential and concurrent behavior are possible,
for example a sequential component which contains concurrent
subcomponents.
