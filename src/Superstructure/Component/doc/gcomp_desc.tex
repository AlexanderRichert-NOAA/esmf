%\subsection{Description}

< a specialization of the generic Component object.  what's different...>

< conceptually simplest is a sequential component, which 
takes an import state, runs the requested time, and produces
an export state.  also possible are concurrent components
which take a transform as input, and then run until the stop
time.  when communication is needed, the transform routine
is called. all data goes thru states. >
