%\subsection{Use and Examples}

A Coupler Component manages the transformation of data between Components.
It contains a list of State objects and the operations needed to
make them compatible, including such things as regridding and unit conversion.
Coupler Components are user-written, following prescribed ESMF interfaces
and, wherever desired, using ESMF infrastructure tools.
