%\subsection{Description}

Transform objects contains lists of transformations to be
applied to Export States in order to create new Import States.
In a sequential execution model, Transform methods can be called 
directly from a Coupler Component and a Transform object is
not needed.  
In a concurrent execution model, where
the exchange of States between Components is done internally to
the Component, a Transform object is passed into the Component
to provide the call-back functions which perform the transformations.
This method allows the Component code to be independent of
what other Components it is being coupled with.

Transformation methods include such operations as 
regridding, interpolation, unit conversion, accumulation and averaging.
Methods may be required to be conservative of some total quantity.
