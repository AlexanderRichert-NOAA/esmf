%\subsection{Description}
\label{sec:CplComp}

In a large, multi-component application such as a forecasting or 
climate prediction system running within ESMF, physical domains 
and major system functions are represented as Gridded Components 
(see Section \ref{sec:GridComp}).  A Coupler Component, or 
{\tt ESMF\_CplComp}, arranges and executes the data 
transformations between one or more Gridded Components.  Since
Coupler Components contain all the information about the way
Gridded Components relate to each other, within ESMF Gridded 
Components can be designed so that they can be used in multiple 
coupled configurations without changes to their source code. 

Like Gridded Components, Coupler Components have two parts, one
that is provided by the user and another that is part of the 
framework.  The user-written portion of the software is the coupling
code necessary for the particular exchange.  The term ``user-written'' 
is somewhat misleading here, since the user can leverage 
ESMF infrastructure software for regridding, redistribution,
lower-level communications, calendar management, and other functions 
within the coupler.  However, ESMF does not currently offer tools for
unit tranformations or time averaging operations, so users must 
manage those operations themseves.

The user-written coupler code must be divided into separately callable 
initialize, run, and finalize methods.  The interfaces for these 
methods are prescribed by ESMF.

Couplers can be written to transform data between single pairs of 
Gridded Components, or a single Coupler can couple between multiple 
Gridded Components.
