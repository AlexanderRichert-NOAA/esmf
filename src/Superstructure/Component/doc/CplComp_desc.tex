%\subsection{Description}

A Coupler Component is user-written code which executes or
arranges the execution of the necessary data transformations between one
or more Gridded Components.


A Coupler operates on a list of State objects.  Couplers can be written
to transform data between single pairs of Gridded Components, or
a single Coupler can couple between multiple Gridded Components.
