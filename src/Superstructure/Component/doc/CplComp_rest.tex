%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf No automatic unit conversions.}  The ESMF framework does not currently 
contain tools for performing unit conversions, operations that are fairly 
standard within Coupler Components.

\item {\bf No accumulator.}  The ESMF does not have an accumulator tool, to
perform time averaging of fields for coupling.  This is likely to be developed
in the near term.

\end{enumerate}
