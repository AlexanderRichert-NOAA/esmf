%\subsection{Use and Examples}

A Component Tunnel connects a {\em dual} Component to an {\em actual} Component. This connection can be based on a number of different low level implementations, e.g. VM-based or socket-based. VM-based Component Tunnels require that both dual and actual Components run within the same application (i.e. execute under the same MPI\_COMM\_WORLD). Socket-based Component Tunnels, on the other hand, support dual and actual Components running in separate applications, and therefore under different MPI\_COMM\_WORLD.
