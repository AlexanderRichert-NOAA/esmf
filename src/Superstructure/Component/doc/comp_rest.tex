%\subsubsection{Restrictions}

Components can be written to run either sequentially or concurrently.
A sequential Component is expected to be called after
its Import State is ready, and to return at the end of the requested
time interval with a finished Export State.  A concurrent Component
is expected to have an internal time advance loop, and to make 
Transform calls when data is ready to be Imported or Exported.
It is not expected that a single Application will be able to 
transparently replace sequential Components with concurrent ones
or visa versa.
It is also not expected that a single Component should be able 
to function in both modes.
