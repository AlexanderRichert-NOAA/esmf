%\subsubsection{Restrictions}

Components can be written to run either sequentially or concurrently.
A sequential Component is expected to be called after
its Import State is ready, and to return at the end of the requested
time interval with a finished Export State.  A concurrent Component
is expected to have an internal time advance loop, and to make 
Transform calls when data is ready to be Imported or Exported.
It is not intended that an Application be able to 
transparently replace sequential Components with concurrent ones
or visa versa.
It is also not expected that a single Component must be able 
to function in both modes, although Components of different
types can be nested, for example a sequentially called 
Component can contain multiple nested concurrent components
or visa versa.
