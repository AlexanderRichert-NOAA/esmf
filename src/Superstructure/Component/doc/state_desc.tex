%\subsection{Description}

A State object contains the data and description information needed to
communicate data between multiple Components.

If a Gridded Component object needs data
from another Component to run it will query its associated
Import State for the data.  If a Gridded Component creates data
needed by another Component it will put that data into an
Export State.  A Coupler Component can read one or more Export States,
operate on the data as required, and can create one or more Import States.
