%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\bf Flags not fully implemented.}
The flags for indicating various qualities associated with 
data items in a State - validity, whether or not the item is
required for restart, read/write status - are not fully implemented.
Although their defaults can be set, the associated methods for 
setting and getting these flags have not been implemented.
(The {\tt needed} flag is fully supported.)

\item{\bf No synchronization of object ids at object create time.}
Object IDs are using during the reconcile process to identify objects
which are unknown to some subset of the PETs in the currently running VM.
Object IDs are assigned in sequential order at object create time.

One important request by the user community during the ESMF object design was
that there be no communication overhead or synchronization when creating
distributed ESMF objects. As a consequence it is required to create these
objects in {\bf unison} across all PETs in order to keep the ESMF object
identifiaction in sync.

\end{enumerate}
