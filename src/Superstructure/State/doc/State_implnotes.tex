%\subsection{Design and Implementation Notes}

States contain the name of the associated Component, a flag for Import
or Export, and a list of data objects, which can be a combination of
Bundles, Fields, and/or Arrays.  The objects must be named and have
the proper attributes so they can be identified by the receiver of
the data.  For example, units and other detailed information
may need to be associated with the data as an Attribute.
