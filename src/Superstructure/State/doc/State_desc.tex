%\subsection{Description}

A State contains the data and metadata to be transferred between 
ESMF components.  It is an important class, because it defines a 
standard for how data is represented in Earth science components.  The 
State construct is a rational compromise between a fully prescribed 
interface - one that would dictate what specific fields should be 
transferred between components - and an interface in which data structures
are completely ad hoc.

There are two types of States, import and export.
An import State contains data that is necessary for a Gridded Component
or Coupler Component to execute, and an export State contains the data
that a Gridded Component or Coupler Component can make available.

States can contain Bundles, Fields, Arrays, and other States.  They
cannot contain Fortran arrays.

State methods include creation and deletion, adding and retrieving 
data items, adding and retrieving attributes, and performing queries.
