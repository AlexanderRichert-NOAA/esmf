%\subsection{Description}

A State object contains the data and sufficient
description information needed to communicate intermediate results
between multiple Gridded Components and/or Coupling Components.
If a Gridded Component object needs data
from another Component to run, it queries its associated
Import State for the data.  If a Gridded Component creates data
needed by another Component, it puts that data into its
Export State.  A Coupler Component can read one or more Export States,
operate on the data as required, and can create one or more Import States.
Couplers can be written to couple individual pairs of States, or
a single Coupler can couple many-to-many States.
