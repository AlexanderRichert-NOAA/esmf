%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\bf Only States.}
The current implementation of Attachable Methods is limited to the ESMF State
class. States are a general container class for Fields, FieldBundles, Arrays
and ArrayBundles. States provide the most general interface to Attachable
Methods. Dependent on future requirements, the Attachable Methods concept may
be extended to other ESMF data classes as the need arises.

\end{enumerate}
