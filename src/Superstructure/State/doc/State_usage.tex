%\subsection{Use and Examples}

A State object encapsulates all data being communicated into and
out of a Gridded Component.  No private communication
of data between Components is permitted in order to maintain the
independence of Components; to enable Components to be replaced
without rewriting the internal code inside the Component.

States can be create and deleted, have data added or deleted from them,
and queried for various kinds of information.

Transform methods operate on States, doing regridding, interpolation,
summation, averaging, transposes, and other operations needed to
make the export State of one Component suitable for import to another
Component.

The CF naming convention for data should be followed.
