%\subsubsection{Restrictions}

It is possible for the main program to directly
create subcomponents and execute the main time loop.
This would result in one less source file.  But then the program
is not structured with a single top level Component that could be
embedded into some higher level application at some future time.
The requirement that there be a single top level Component is not 
too onerous since the main program can in most cases be an exact 
copy of the AppDriver code, and the user can think of the top
level Component as in some sense the main program code.
