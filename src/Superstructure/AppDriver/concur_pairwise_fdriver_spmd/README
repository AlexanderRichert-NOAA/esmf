This directory contains the starting files needed to build an ESMF
Application with: concurrent execution, a pairwise Coupling Component,
a main program in Fortran, and the same executable is started on each
computational node (SPMD).


To compile as-is for testing, run 'gmake' in this directory.
The resulting skeleton and driver files should produce an executable
which can be run and will print out messages during each stage of execution.


To use these files as a basis for a real application begin by copying
them to another directory.  Then edit the child Coupler and Grid
Component Template files to reflect the actual data passed between
components and the computations necessary.  If needed, edit the Parent
Grid Component file.  The AppDriver file should be useable for
most applications without changes.
