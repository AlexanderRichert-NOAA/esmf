This directory contains the starting files needed to build an ESMF
Application with sequential execution, a pair-wise Coupling Component,
and a main program in Fortran. 


To compile as-is for testing, simply run 'gmake' in this directory.

The resulting skeleton and driver files should produce an executable
which can be run and will print out messages during each stage of execution.


Then to begin to customize the Component files.  The AppDriver file
can be used as-is with most applications.
