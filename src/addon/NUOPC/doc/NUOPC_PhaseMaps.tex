\label{PhaseMaps}

ESMF introduces the concept of standard component methods: {\tt Initialize}, {\tt Run}, and {\tt Finalize}. ESMF further recognizes the need for being able to split each of the standard methods into multiple phases. On the ESMF level, phases are implemented by a simple integer {\tt phase} index. The NUOPC layer adds an abstraction layer that allows phases to be referenced by label.

For complex scenarios, e.g. multiple versions of multi-stage initialize sequences, the use of an integer based phase index quickly becomes confusing. The NUOPC Layer addresses this issue by introducing three component level attributes: {\tt InitializePhaseMap}, {\tt RunPhaseMap}, and {\tt FinalizePhaseMap}. These attributes map logical NUOPC phase labels to integer ESMF phase indices. A NUOPC compliant component fully documents its available phases through the phase maps.

Currently the NUOPC Layer leverages the {\tt InitializePhaseMap} during the initialization loop that is implemented by the generic {\tt NUOPC\_Driver}. It looks for phase map entries according to the initialize phase definition outlined in section \ref{DataDepInit}. The {\tt RunPhaseMap} is used when setting up run sequences in the Driver. The {\tt NUOPC\_DriverAddRunElement()} takes the {\tt phaseLabel} argument, and uses the {\tt RunPhaseMap} attribute internally to translates the label into the corresponding ESMF phase index.

The {\tt NUOPC\_DriverAddRunElement()} further references components via labels. Each component is added to the Driver by calling {\tt NUOPC\_DriverAddComp()}, which requires that a unique label for this component instance is provided. Connectors are identified by providing the source and destination component label.
