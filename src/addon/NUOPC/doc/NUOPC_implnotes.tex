The NUOPC Layer is implemented in Fortran on top of the public ESMF Fortran API.

The NUOPC utility routines form a very straight forward Fortran API, accessible through the {\tt NUOPC} Fortran module. The interfaces only use native Fortran types and public ESMF derived types. In order to access the utility API of the NUOPC Layer, user code must include the following two {\tt use} lines:

\begin{verbatim}
  use ESMF
  use NUOPC
\end{verbatim}

The NUOPC generic components are implemented as a {\em collection} of Fortran modules. Each module implements a single, well specified set of standard {\tt ESMF\_GridComp} or {\tt ESMF\_CplComp} methods. The nomenclature of the generic component modules starts with the {\tt NUOPC\_} prefix, then continues with {\tt Driver}, {\tt Model}, {\tt Mediator}, or {\tt Connector} followed optionally by a string of descriptive terms.

The user code accesses the desired generic component(s) by including a {\tt use} line for each one. Each generic component defines a small set of public names that are made available to the user code through the {\tt use} statement. At a minimum the {\tt SetServices} method is made public. Some generic components also define a public internal state type by the standard name {\tt InternalState}. It is recommended that the following syntax is used when accessing a generic component (here with internal state):

\begin{verbatim}
  use NUOPC_DriverXYZ, only: &
    DriverXYZ_SS => SetServices, &
    DriverXYZ_IS => InternalState
\end{verbatim}

A generic component is used by user code to implement a specialized version of the component. The user code therefore also must implement a public {\tt SetServices} routine. The first thing this routine must do is call into the {\tt SetServices} routine provided by the generic component. It is through this step that the specialized component {\em inherits} from the generic component.

There are three mechanisms through which user code specializes generic components.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The specializing user code must set entry points for standard component methods not implemented by the generic component. Methods (and phases) that need to be implemented are clearly documented in the generic component description. The user code may further overwrite standard methods already implemented by the generic component code. However, this should rarely be necessary, and may indicate that there is a better fitting generic component available. Finally, some generic components come with generic routines that are suitable candidates for the standard component methods, yet require that the specializing code registers them as appropriate. Setting entry points for standard component methods is done in the {\tt SetServices} routine right after calling into the generic {\tt SetServices} method.

\item Some generic components require that specific methods are attached to the component. If a generic component uses specialization through attachable methods, the specific method labels (i.e. the names by which these methods are registered) and the purpose of the method are clearly documented. In some cases attachable methods are optional. This is clearly documented. Further, some generic components attach a default method to a label, which then is used for all phases. This default can be overwritten with a phase specific attachable method. Attaching methods to the component should be done in the {\tt SetServices} routine right after setting entry points for the standard component methods.

\item Some generic components provide access to an internal state type. The documentation of a generic component indicates which internal state members are used for specialization, and how they are expected to be set. Setting internal state members often requires the availability of other pieces of information. It may happend in the {\tt SetServices} routine, but more often inside a specialized standard entry point or an attachable method.

Components that inherit from a generic component may choose to only specialize certain aspects, leaving other aspects unspecified. This allows a hierarchy of generic components to be implemented with a high degree of code re-use. The variable level of specialization supports the very differing user needs. Figure \ref{fig:NUOPCGenericComp} depicts the inheritance structure of the NUOPC Generic Components. There are two trees, one is rooted in {\tt ESMF\_GridComp}, while the other is rooted in {\tt ESMF\_CplComp}.
