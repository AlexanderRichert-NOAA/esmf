\section{Test Harness Suite Report}
This document summarizes the setup of each individual test case in a test harness test suite. 
Each class has a top level configuration file for each ensemble. \\ \\

Some ESMF classes have a set of test harness test suites. \\
A test suite is defined by its top level configuration file. \\
A test suite has set of test descriptions. \\
A test description has set of problem descriptor strings. \\
A problem description string has a transformation, a distribution description file,
and a grid description file. \\
A distribution description file has a set of distributions definitions.
A distribution definition describes how a source distribution is transformed 
to a destination distribution. \\
A grid description file has a set of grids definitions.
A grid definition has the size of the grid, the coordinate range, the grid type, and grid 
units of measure for each dimension. \\
Test cases are generated by transforming each grid on each distribution. \\



This document can be viewed as two separate reports: one summarizing the redistribution
for each test case and the other showing the setup for each test case. \\

\subsection{Document Structure}
This is some text.

\subsection{Document Generation Instructions}
This document is generated by running gmake from within the \$ESMF\_DIR/src/testharness/catalog
directory.  Since the program to process the test harness resource files is part of the unit test suite,
it requires the mpi environment with a single processor. \\

Prior to generating the catalog, build unit tests to make the test harness and
latex source postprocessor. \\
