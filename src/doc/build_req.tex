\sreq{Build}

\ssreq{Build system will use GNU Make}
The build system will utilize the Build program Make from
GNU.  Other vendors makes will not be supported.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 1. \\
{\bf Source:} ESMF/CSS. \\
{\bf Status:} DRAFT. \\
{\bf Verification:} Makefiles will test make being used and generate
warning if GNU make not being used.
\end{reqlist}

\ssreq{Easily customize build for local machine}
The ESMF shall have the ability to easily customize the build evironment. 
System libraries that are required can be set easily, without modifying 
the build files directly. If the paths to required system libraries 
are not provided or incorrect the build system will let the user know 
how to set them and die gracefully.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Priority:} 2. \\
{\bf Source:} CCSM-CPL. \\
{\bf Status:} Approved-2. \\
{\bf Verification:} Set library paths correctly and incorrectly and test that 
the build acts appropriately.
\end{reqlist}
