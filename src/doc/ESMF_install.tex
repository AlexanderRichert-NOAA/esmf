\subsection{ESMF Download Options}

Major releases of the ESMF software can be downloaded by following
the instructions on the 
the {\bf Downloads \& Documentation} page on the ESMF 
website, \htmladdnormallink{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}.  There are two options for using the ESMF:

\begin{itemize}
\item Download a pre-built ESMF shared object library and
test applications for a particular platform.  If you choose
this approach, you can skip ahead to Section~\ref{UsingLibrary},
Using the ESMF.  
\item Download the full ESMF source code, and compile and link
the framework to any necessary system libraries.  This will
result in a shared object file (with a *.so extension)
that can be linked in with the user's code, or with the demo
{ESMF\_COUPLED\_FLOW} executable.  In this case you will need
to follow all the instructions in subsequent sections of the 
{\it Quick Start} guide, beginning with Section~\ref{InstallProcedures},
Installation.
\end{itemize}

You may find it necessary to build the ESMF yourself
if we do not offer a shared object library for the current
version of your compiler.  The compiler versions that we offer
shared objects for are noted on the download web page.

\subsection{Installation}
\label{InstallProcedures}

\input{ESMF_systemreq}

\subsubsection{ESMF Environment Variables}

The following environment variables must be set:
\begin{verbatim}
  ESMF_DIR      top-level ESMF directory
  ESMF_ARCH     platform and compiler configuration
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Supported Platforms}
\input{user_arch.tex}

Simultaneous multiple architecture builds are supported, with
one restriction; the test cases may only be run on one platform at a time. 

\subsubsection{Building the ESMF Libraries}
\label{BuildESMF}

Build the library with the command:
\begin{verbatim}
  gmake BOPT=g  
\end{verbatim}
  for a debug version or
\begin{verbatim}
  gmake BOPT=O  
\end{verbatim}
  for an optimized version.

% GNU make requirement.  File in build/doc
\input{user_make.tex}

Build options that enable you to copy the library and *.mod files to
specified directories are explained in Section~\ref{BuildOptions}. 

\subsubsection{Building the ESMF Documentation}
\label{BuildDocumentation}

\noindent To build documentation:
\begin{verbatim}
  gmake dvi           ! Makes the dvi files.
  gmake pdf           ! Makes the pdf files.
  gmake html          ! Creates the html directory.
  gmake alldoc        ! Builds all the above documents.
\end{verbatim}

\noindent To build documentation for one module:

\noindent First change directory to the where the desired module's documentation resides;  for
example, to build the {\tt TimeMgmt} documentation start with:

\begin{verbatim}
cd ${ESMF_DIR}/src/Infrastructure/TimeMgmt/doc
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Next issue one of the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
  gmake localdvi      ! Builds local dvi files.
  gmake localpdf      ! Builds local pdf files.
  gmake localhtml     ! Builds local html files.
  gmake localdoc      ! Builds all of the local documents.
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The output from this local documentation build is in the top level {\tt doc}
directory, as with the previous commands.
