The sections that follow outline the classes in ESMF.
In this document we use the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as a visual tool 
to express the structure of 
classes, to define the relationships between classes, and to describe sequences
of actions.  The diagrams are reasonably intuitive, and we provide 
only a basic explanation of concepts.  A reader interested in more detail should 
refer to a text such as ``The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual.''
