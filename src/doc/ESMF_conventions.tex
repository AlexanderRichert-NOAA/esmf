\section{Document Conventions}
\label{sec:conventions}

In this document we use the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as a visual tool 
to express the structure of 
classes, to define relationships between classes, and to describe sequences
of actions.  The diagrams are reasonably intuitive, and we provide 
only a basic explanation of concepts.  A reader interested in more detail should 
refer to a text such as {\it The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual.} \ref{uml}

Other conventions in this document: 
\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\tt Courier text} & {Class name} \\
{\it Italic text} & {Document} 
\end{tabular}
