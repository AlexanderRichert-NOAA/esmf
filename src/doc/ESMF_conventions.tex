Diagrams are drawn using the Unified Modeling Language (UML).  UML is 
a visual tool that can illustrate the structure of 
classes, define relationships between classes, and describe sequences
of actions.  A reader interested in more detail should refer to a 
text such as {\it The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual.}
