\section{Document Conventions}
\label{sec:conventions}

In this document we use the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as a visual tool 
to express the structure of 
classes, to define the relationships between classes, and to describe sequences
of actions.  The diagrams are reasonably intuitive, and we provide 
only a basic explanation of concepts.  A reader interested in more detail should 
refer to a text such as {\it The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual.}

Other conventions in this document: 
\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\tt Courier text} & {Code fragment, class name} \\
\end{tabular}
