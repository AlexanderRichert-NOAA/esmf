\subsection{Diagrams}

In this document we use the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as a visual tool 
to express the structure of 
classes, to define relationships between classes, and to describe sequences
of actions.  The diagrams are reasonably intuitive, and we provide 
only a basic explanation of concepts.  A reader interested in more detail shouldrefer to a text such as {\it The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual.}
