\subsection{Demonstration Application}
\label{sec:demo}

In this section we describe the {\tt ESMF\_COUPLED\_WAVE} demonstration code that 
illustrates usage of both the ESMF infrastructure and superstructure. 

\subsubsection{Coupled Wave Demonstration Description}

One gridded component will solve the compressible time-dependent fluid 
flow equations.  The algorithm applies an explicit solution technique to 
a staggered, Arakawa C gridtype.  We will assume the grid is cartesian, 
uniform and logically rectangular.  State variables, including density, 
pressure, viscosity and temperature, are located at cell-centers, while 
velocities are located at cell faces.  This component will be 
initialized with a steady-state, one-dimensional flow.  The second 
gridded component will inject fluid into the first normal to the flow 
along one of the boundaries.  The injected fluid will have arbitrary 
velocity, temperature, density and duration, effectively setting some of 
the boundary conditions for the first component.  This component will 
sit on a different cartesian grid to provide a test of the regrid 
functionality.
