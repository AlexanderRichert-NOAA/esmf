\section{Release Notes}

The purpose of ESMF v1.0 is to provide a first look at the ESMF
Application Programming Interface (API), and to demonstrate the viability 
of the ESMF architecture and implementation.  For this release, we have focused 
on implementing major architectural features and basic functionality.  The 
current performance characteristics and memory requirements of the software 
are unlikely to resemble those in later releases.

Our next major release, ESMF v2.0, will occur in April 2004.  At that time, 
the {\it ESMF User Guide} will be expanded to include a comprehensive section 
on how to adapt application codes for the framework, and support staff will be 
available to assist users with ESMF adoption.  We do not anticipate preparing other public
releases or patches for v1.0 between now and the next release - our focus
will be on developing an easy to use, production-quality product.  We are 
relying on Earth system modelers to provide us with the feedback necessary 
to realize this goal.  Section \ref{sec:Support} of this document includes 
instructions on submitting comments on ESMF v1.0 to our development team.
