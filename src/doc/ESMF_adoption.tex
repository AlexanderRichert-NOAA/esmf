\section{Looking Ahead:  How to Adapt Applications for ESMF}
\label{sec:Adoption}

In this section we describe how to bring existing applications into the framework.

\subsection{Individual Components}

\begin{enumerate}

\item[Decide what parts will become Gridded Components]

A Gridded Component is a self-contained
piece of code which will be initialized, will be called once or many times
to run, and then will be finalized.  It will be expected to either take in
data from other Components/models, produce data, or both.

Generally a computational model like an Ocean or Atmosphere model will
map either to a single Component or to a set of multiple nested
components.

\item[Decide what data is produced]

A Component provides data to other models using an ESMF State
object.  A Component needs to fill the State object with a description of
all possible values that can be produced by this model.  Depending on what
other models are coupled with this Component, an external piece of code
will be responsible for marking which of these items are actually going to
be needed.  Then the Component can choose to either produce all possible
data items (simpler but less efficient) or only produce the data items
marked as being needed.  The Component should consult the CF data naming
conventions when it is listing what data it can produce.

\item[Decide what data is needed]

A Component gets data from other models using an ESMF State object.
The CF data naming conventions are used for the Component to query
the State object and get the actual data from the State.

\item[Make the data blocks private]

A Component needs to communicate to other models only through the
framework.  All global data items need to be private to the F90 module,
and ideally would be isolated to a single derived type which is allocated
at run time.   

\item[Divide the code up into start/middle/end phases]

A Component needs to provide 3 subroutines which take care of
Initialization, Running, and Finalization.  (For codes which have
multiple phases of init, run, finalize it is possible to have
multiple init, run, and finalize subroutines.)

The Initialization subroutine needs to allocate space, initialize
data items, boundary conditions, whatever else the model needs in
order to run.

For a sequential application in which all components are on the same
set of processors, the run phase will
be called multiple times.  Each time the model is expected to take in
any new data from other models, do its computation, and produce data
needed by other components.   A concurrent model, in which different
components are run on different processors, may execute the same 
way or have its run routine called
only once and may use different parts of the framework to arrange
data exchange with other models.

The Finalization subroutine needs to release space, write out results,
close open files, and generally close down the computation gracefully.

\item[Make a "Set Services" subroutine]

Components need to provide only a single externally visible entry point.
It will be called at start time, and its job is to register with the
framework which routines satisfy the Initialization, Run, and Finalize
requirements.  It can also register the address of its private data block.

\item[Create ESMF Fields and Bundles for holding data]

An ESMF State object is fundamentally an annotated list of other
ESMF items, most often expected to be ESMF Fields.  Other things
which can be placed in a State object are Bundles (groups of Fields
on the same grid), Arrays (raw data with no gridding/coordinate information)
and other States (generally used by Coupling code).  Any data which is
going to be received from other Components or sent to other components
needs to have the proper ESMF objects created for them.

To create an ESMF Field the code must create an ESMF Array object to
contain the data values, and usually an ESMF Grid object to describe the
computational grid where the values are located.  If this is an
observational data stream the locations of the data values will be held in
an ESMF Location Stream object instead of a Grid.

\item[Be able to read an ESMF clock]

During the execution of the Run routine, the information about the
entire programs concept of the global time will come into the Component
as an ESMF Clock object.  The component needs to be able to at least
query the clock for the current time using the Framework subroutines.

\item[Decide how much of the lower level infrastructure to use]

The ESMF framework provides a rich set of time management functions,
data management and query functions, IO functions, and other utility
routines which help to insulate the user's code from the vast differences
in hardware architectures, system software, and runtime environments.
It is up to the user to select which parts of these functions they
choose to use.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{A full executable program}

\begin{enumerate}

\item[Decide on which components to use]

Select from the set of ESMF components available.

\item[Understand the data flow in order to customize a Coupler component]

Examine what data is produced by each component and what data is
needed by each component.  The role of a Coupler component in the
ESMF Framework is to set up any needed regridding and data conversions
to match output data from one component to input data in another.

\item[Write or adapt a Coupler component]

Decide on a strategy for how to do the Coupling.  There can be a single
Coupler for the application or multiple Couplers.
Single couplers follow a "hub and
spoke" model in which all data conversion/transfer is arranged
by a single Coupler.
Multiple Couplers can couple between subsets of the Components, and
can be written to couple either only one-way
(e.g. output of component A into input of component B), or two-way
(both A to B and B to A).  

The coupler must understand several ESMF objects including ESMF data objects
such as States, Fields, Bundles, Grids, Arrays; ESMF services
such as Regrid and Route; and ESMF execution/environment objects
such as Layouts.    

\item[Write or adapt a main program]

The main program must first create an Application Component.  This
will ensure that the Framework initialization code is called and will
provide the environment for other components to be created and run.

The final thing the main program must do is Destroy the Application 
Component.
This will close down the framework and release any associated resources.

The Application component is then responsible for Creating other top level
Components including Gridded Components and Coupler Components.  It
contains the main time loop and is responsible for calling the
"SetServices" entry point for each Component it creates.
