\section{Overview of Distributed Data Methods}

Bundles, Fields, and Arrays all have versions of the following
data communication methods.  In ESMF, data is communicated 
between DEs.  Depending on the underlying communication 
mechanism, this may translate within the framework to a data 
copy, an MPI call, or something else.

There is a common object handle, an {\tt ESMF\_RouteHandle}, which
allows communication patterns to be precomputed during 
initialization and the information stored in that RouteHandle.
By specifying a RouteHandle at execution time, only
the source and destination data pointers must be supplied and the
runtime overhead is minimized.

\subsection{Higher Level Functions}
The following three methods are intended to map closely to 
needs of applications programs.  They represent higher level
communications and are described in more detail in the following
sections.  They are:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Halo}
Halo operations update ghost-cell or halo regions at the boundaries
of a local data decomposition.
\item {\bf Regrid}
Regrid methods transform data from one Grid to another.
\item {\bf Redist}
Redistribution methods move data associated with a single Grid but
with different decompositions.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lower Level Functions}
The following methods correspond closely to the lower level
MPI communications primitives.  They are:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Gather}
Reassembling data which is decomposed over a set of DEs into a single
block of data on one DE.
\item {\bf AllGather}
Reassembling data which is decomposed over a set of DEs into multiple
copies of a single block of data, one copy per original DE.
\item {\bf Scatter}
Spreading an undecomposed block of data on one DE over a set of DEs,
decomposing that single block into smaller subsets of data, one
data decomposition per DE.
\item {\bf AlltoAll}
Spreading an undecomposed block of data from multiple DEs onto
each of the other DEs in the set, resulting in a set of multiple decomposed 
data blocks per DE, one from each of the original source DEs.
\item {\bf Broadcast}
Spreading an undecomposed block of data from one DE onto all other
DEs, where the resulting data is still undecomposed and simply
copied to all other DEs.
\item {\bf Reduction}
Computing a single data value, e.g. the data maximum, minimum, sum, etc
from a group of decomposed data blocks across a set of DEs, where the
result is delivered to a single DE.
\item {\bf AllReduce}
Computing a single data value, e.g. the data maximum, minimum, sum, etc
from a group of decomposed data blocks across a set of DEs, where the
result is delivered to all DEs in the set.

\end{itemize}
