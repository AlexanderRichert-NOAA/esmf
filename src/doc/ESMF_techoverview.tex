\section{Installing and Building the ESMF}
\label{sec:TechOver}

This section goes into more detail about how to build
the ESMF software, and how to customize the build if
your platform is not supported by the makefiles packaged
with the system.

% since we really do not yet support installation correctly; e.g. you
% cannot move a shared library after anything which has linked to it
% (like our tests and examples) without telling the executables the eventual
% destination; remove this section for now.  Also, it was only moving the
% lib and mod files - nothing about the C++ header files, the examples,
% the demos, etc.

\label{sec:TechOver2}

This section goes into more detail about how to run the tests which are
included with the ESMF software, how to run the examples, demos, and
