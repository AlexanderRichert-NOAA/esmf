\subsection{Schedule of Developer and User Documentation}
\label{sec:docs}

Below is a schedule of documents that shall be prepared for the ESMF, as provided
to NASA September 28, 2001 and agreed on during the NASA Site Visit on 
December 4-5, 2001.  In response to the needs of the project some documents 
were prepared ahead of schedule, and information was shifted to a different 
document than originally planned.  Notes on these changes are contained in 
square brackets [].

\begin{tabular}{c p{2in}p{3in}}
{\bf Date (Milestone)}  & {\bf Document} & {\bf Contents} \\ 
May 2002 (A) & 
{\it Draft Software Developer's Guide} &
Recommended and required practices for those developing the core 
framework.  Shall include coding conventions, document templates,
configuration management procedures, and software quality assurance 
procedures. Subsequent versions of the Developer's Guide (for Milestones 
F and K) shall include comprehensive sections on how to extend and
maintain the framework.\\

  & {\it General Requirements Document} &
Overall, high level requirements for the ESMF software. The General
Requirements Document shall also include framework-wide requirements,
such as platforms to be supported.  \\

Aug. 2002 (H) & {\it Architecture Document} &
Layering strategy and major classes in the ESMF.  This document shall 
include a high-level description of how major classes in the framework
interact. \\

  & {\it Implementation Report} &
Analysis of options for implementation language, language interoperability, 
programming model, and support for scalar and vector processors. \\

  & {\it Build and Test Plan} &
Development plan for the ESMF Core Team and ESMF Deployment Teams.  
Analysis of software dependencies and chart of sequence 
in which ESMF classes will be developed and integrated.  Includes 
major system integration and validation events.  Prepared using 
a tool such as Microsoft Project. \\

April 2003 (F) & {\it Draft Software Developer's Guide} &
Updated Software Developer's Guide for developers transitioning from 
the design phase to implementation of the framework. \\

  & {\it Draft Class Requirements Documents} &
Analysis of requirements for each major class or set of related 
classes in the framework. [A draft of the class requirements 
documents was prepared early, at Milestone A.]\\

  & {\it Draft Class Design Documents} &
Detailed design including API specification for each 
major class or set of related classes in the framework. \\

April 2004 (G) & {\it Class Requirements Documents} &
Updated requirements. \\
 
  & {\it Class Design Documents} &
Updated detailed design and API specifications. \\

Jan. 2005 (K) & {\it User's Guide} &
How to install and run the ESMF, including a specification of
system requirements necessary for operating the framework.  Includes 
sufficient explanation to enable users 
to understand benefits the framework offers, how it is structured, 
and how it works.  [A draft of the User's Guide was prepared early,
at Milestone F.]\\
  & {\it API Reference} &
Description of the ESMF interface and the function of each public 
method. \\ 
  & {\it Software Developer's Guide} &
Updated Software Developer's Guide to enable ESMF extension and
maintenance. \\  

\end{tabular}

We note that at NASA's request the Developer's Guide has been extended
to include some guidelines for developing framework applications as well as
the core framework.
