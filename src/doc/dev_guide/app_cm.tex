\section{Configuration Management}
\label{sec:app_cm}

JMC codes are stored within repositories maintained by the 
group or institution responsible for their design, development,
maintenance, and funding.  We expect each of these groups to employ some 
version control system and a tagging convention.  

A brief description of the configuration management procedures 
and tagging conventions for each collaborating group will be provided 
at Milestone H and incorporated into this document.

If issues arise with versioning and tracing of modifications that 
could impact the stability and long-term viability of the JMC codes, 
the ESMF technical leads will work with the application owning 
institutions to define and ensure the implementation of a satisfactory 
process.

\subsection{Backups}

All application codes in the JMC suite are backed up periodically 
in conformance with the procedures of each individual Deployment Team 
application group.
