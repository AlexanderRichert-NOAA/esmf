\section{Apps}
\label{sec:Apps}

The ESMF source distribution contains a few executables that are built on top
of the ESMF library during installation. These executables are referred to as
{\em apps}. Apps are command line tools intended to be used by the end user of
ESMF. ESMF follows the GNU conventions for command line tools. There are 
currently three mandatory command line options that every distributed app must
implement:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt --help} Print a help message, documenting all of the available 
command line arguments and their usage.
\item {\tt --version} Print the version of ESMF in long format and the 
copyright message.
\item {\tt --V} Print just the version string of ESMF.
\end{itemize}
