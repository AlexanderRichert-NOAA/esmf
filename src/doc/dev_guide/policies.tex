\section{Policies}

\subsection{External Software Libraries}
\label{sec:lib}

ESMF developers are encouraged to use as few external
software libraries as possible, to minimize the effort
needed to build and run the ESMF software.  The external
utilities and libraries that the ESMF 
distribution relies on are listed on the {\bf Downloads \&
Documentation} page of the ESMF website.  None of them are 
currently included in the ESMF source.

\subsection{Graphics Packages}

ESMF uses the MS Visio package to produce its graphics.
Both Visio files and *.eps files are checked into the 
main repository.
