\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) {\it Software Developer's Guide},
or simply the {\it Guide}, 
is the reference handbook that describes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item general practices related to the ESMF project;
\item the development practices, standards, and conventions recommended 
for ESMF core software;  
\item guidelines and recommended procedures for ESMF collaborators 
incorporating the framework into their applications.
\end{enumerate}

The ESMF sotware implementation is led by a Core Team based in the 
Scientific Computing Division (SCD) of the NSF National Center for Atmospheric 
Research (NCAR).  Members of the Core Team and the ESMF user base are 
collectively referred to as the {\it ESMF Joint Specification Team}.

Much of this document was derived from the \htmladdnormallink{{\it GFDL 
Flexible Modeling System Developers' Manual}}{http://www.gfdl.gov/\~{}vb/FMSManual}
\cite{FMSdevguide} and the \htmladdnormallink{{\it Community Climate System Model Software
  Developer's Guide}}{http://www.ccsm.ucar.edu/csm/working\_groups/Software/dev\_guide/dev\_guide}
\cite{CCSMdevguide}, and has been adapted with the permission of the respective authors.

This is an evolving document.  We will continue to explore and refine
processes and conventions in response to changes in computational 
environment, growth in project maturity and scope, and lessons learned
through experience.

An important source of supplementary information is the ESMF website:
\begin{center}
\htmladdnormallink{{\bf http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}
\end{center}
This website is referred to throughout the {\it Guide}.  
It includes a {\bf Test \& Validation} page, a link to the ESMF
CVS repository, task lists, and many other types of project information.

A specification of what an application developer must implement in
order to utilize the framework is provided in the draft {\it ESMF
User's Guide}\cite{bib:ESMFusrdoc}, available on the ESMF website, 
via the {\bf Downloads \& Documentation} link on the navigation bar.

Suggestions on how to improve the {\it Guide} should be sent to
