\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{About this Document}
The Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) {\it Software Developer's Guide},
or simply the {\it Guide}, is the reference handbook that describes
the practices, standards, and conventions recommended for ESMF core software
development.  It is updated as needed.

Suggestions on how to improve the {\it Guide} should be sent to 
\htmladdnormallink{esmf\_support@ucar.edu}{mailto:esmf\_support@ucar.edu}.

\subsection{Supplementary Information}
An important source of supplementary information is the ESMF website:
\begin{center}
\htmladdnormallink{{\bf http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}
\end{center}
This website is referred to throughout the {\it Guide}.  
It includes a link to the ESMF CVS repository, the current release
schedule, task lists, and many other types of project information.

The {\it Guide} doesn't contain instructions on how to adapt user
codes for ESMF.  This information is included in the {\it ESMF User's
Guide}\cite{bib:ESMFusrdoc}, which is available via the {\bf Downloads \& Documentation} link on the ESMF website navigation bar.
