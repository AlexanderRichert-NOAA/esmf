\section{Software Development Cycle}
\label{sec:life_cycle}

The ESMF development environment has several defining characteristics.
First, both the ESMF Core Team and the JST are distributed.  This makes
incorporating simple, efficient communication mechanisms into the
development process essential.  Second, the JST and Core Team work on
a range of different platforms, at sites that don't have the time, resources,
or inclination to install demanding packages.  We seek out collaboration
tools that require no purchase or installation before use.
Finally, we are committed to open development.  As much as possible, we
try to keep the workings of the ESMF project - metrics,
support and bug lists, schedules, task lists, source code, you name it -
visible to the broad community.

\subsection{Software Process Model}

The ESMF software development cycle is based on the staged 
delivery model \cite{mcconnell96}.  The steps in this software development
model are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Software Concept}  Collect and itemize the high-level requirements of the system and identify the basic functions that the system must perform.

\item {\bf Requirements Analysis} Write and review a requirements document - a detailed statement of the scientific and computational requirements for the software.

\item {\bf Architectural Design} Define a high-level software architecture that outlines the functions, relationships, and interfaces for major components. Write and review an architecture document.

\item {\bf Stage 1, 2, ..., n} Repeat the following steps creating a potentially releasable product at the end of each stage. Each stage produces a more robust, complete version of the software.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Detailed Design} Create a detailed design document and API specification. Incorporate the interface specification 
into a detailed design document and review the design.

\item {\it Code Construction and Unit Testing} Implement the interface, 
debug and unit test.

\item {\it System Testing}  Assemble the complete system, verify that the 
code satisfies all requirements.

\item {\it Release} Create a potentially releasable product, including User's Guide and User's Reference Manual. Frequently code produced at intermediate stages software will be used internally.
\end{itemize}

\item {\bf Code Distribution and Maintenance}  Official public release 
of the software, beginning of maintenance phase. 

\end{enumerate}

We have customized and extended this standard model to suit the ESMF project.
At this stage of ESMF development, we are in the iterative design/implement/release
cycle.  Below are a few notes on earlier stages.  

\subsection{ESMF Process History}

\subsubsection{Software Concept}
Participants in the ESMF project completed the Software Concept
stage in the process of developing a unified set of proposals.
A summary of the high-level requirements of ESMF - a statement of project
scope and vision - is included in the {\it General Requirements}
part of the {\it ESMF Requirements Document}\cite{bib:ESMFreqdoc}.
This was an successful effort in defining the scope of the project
and agreeing to an overall design strategy.

\subsubsection {Requirements Analysis}
The ESMF Team spent about six months on Requirements Analysis at
the start of the project.
The first section of the {\it ESMF Requirements Document} outlines 
the major ESMF capabilities necessary to meet project milestones and achieve 
project goals.  The second part of the document is a detailed 
requirements specification for each functionality class included in 
the framework.  This document also includes a discussion of the 
process that was used to initially collect requirements.
The {\it Requirements Document} was a useful reference for the development
team, especially for new developers coming in from outside of the
Earth science domain.

\subsubsection{Architectural Design}
The project had difficulty preparing an {\it Architecture Document}.  
The comments received back on the completed work, informally and
from a peer review body, indicated that the presentation of the document
was ineffective at conveying how the ESMF worked. Although the
document was full of detailed and complex diagrams, the terminology and
diagrams were oriented to software engineers and were not especially
scientist-friendly.  The detailed diagrams also made the document difficult
to maintain.  

\subsection{Iterative Design and Review}

The following are processes we are actively following.  These
guidelines apply to core team developers and outside contributors
who will be checking code into the main ESMF repository.

All design and code reviews are telecons held with the JST. 
Telecons are scheduled with the core team manager, put on the ESMF
calendar on the home page of the ESMF website, and announced on the
esmf\_jst@ucar.edu list.

\subsubsection{Telecon Etiquette}

When you call in, it's nice to give your name at the first opportunity.
Telecon hosts will make an effort to introduce people on the JST calls,
especially first-timers. Please don't put the telecon on hold (we sometimes
get telecon-stopping music this way).

Within a week after the telecon, the host (the developer if it's a design
or code review) is expected to send out a summary to esmf\_jst@ucar.edu
with the date of the call, the participants, and notes or conclusions.

\subsubsection{Design Reviews}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Introductory telecon(s). The point here is to scope out the problem
at hand. These calls cover the following, as they apply.
\begin{itemize}
\item Understand the capability needed and review requirements.
\item Discuss design alternatives.
\item Survey and discuss any existing packages that cover the new functionality.
\item Discuss potential use test cases.
\item Figure out which customers will be involved in use test case development and identify customers that are likely to provide important input
(sometimes we offer a friendly reminder service to these folks before relevant
telecons).
\end{itemize}

For these introductory discussions, any form of material is fine - diagrams,
slides, plain text ramblings, lists of questions, ...

\item Initial design review(s). The document presented should be in the format
of the ESMF Reference Manual, either in plain text or in latex/ProTeX.
This is so the document can be incorporated into project documentation
after implementation. The initial review document should include at least
the following sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item Class description.
\item Use and Examples. Here the examples begin with the very simplest
cases.
\item API sufficient to cover the examples. This is because it can be difficult
to follow the examples (e.g. tell what arguments and options are) without the
basic API entries accompanying them.
\end{itemize}

This step is iterated until developers and customers converge.

\item Full telecon review(s). The developer should prepare the API specification
using latex and ProTex following the conventions in the Reference Manual.
Most of the Reference Manual section(s) for the new or modified class(es),
including Class Options and Restrictions and Future Work, should be available
at the time of this review. Diagrams should be ready here too.

\item Use test case telecon review. For each major piece of functionality, a use
test case is prepared in collaboration with customers and executed before
release. The use test case is performed on a realistic number of processors
and with realistic input data sets.

It doesn't have to work (and probably won't) before it's reviewed, but it
needs to work before the functionality appears in a release. The developer
checks it into the top-level use\_test\_case directory on SourceForge and
prepares a html page outlining it for the Test \& Validation page on the
ESMF website. Unlike unit and system tests, use test cases aren't
distributed with the ESMF source.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Implementation and Test Before Internal Release}

There is an internal release checklist on the Test \& Validation page of the
ESMF website that contains an exhaustive listing of develop and tester
responsibilities for releases.

The developer is responsible for working with the tester(s) to make sure
that the following are present before an internal release:
\begin{itemize}
\item 100% unit and system test coverage of new interfaces, with the exception
of interfaces where type/kind/rank is heavily overloaded. All arguments tested
at least once.
\item Use test cases work
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation and Test Before Public Release}

There is a public release checklist on the Test \& Validation page of the ESMF
website that contains an exhaustive listing of develop and tester responsibilities for releases.

Same as for internal release, plus:
\begin{itemize}
\item Design and Implementation Notes section for Reference Manual complete.
\item Developer and tester ensure that test coverage for new interfaces is sufficient, implementing any additional tests to make it so. This includes testing of options and tests for error handling and recovery.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Code Check-In}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Both core and contributors should test on at least three platforms before commit.
\item For core team developers, a mail should go out to esmf\_core@ucar.edu
before check-in for very large commits and for commits that will break the
HEAD. For contributors a mail should go out to esmf\_core@ucar.edu before
ANY commit.
\item Core team developers should be set up to receive email from SourceForge
for every check-in.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Code Reviews}
\begin{enumerate}
\item All significant chunks of externally contributed code are reviewed by the JST. It's usual to do the code review after check-in. The code review should
be scheduled with the core team manager when the code is checked in, and
the code review held before the next release.
\item We also do code reviews with core team members, as desired/required
by the JST. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection {Code Construction and Testing}

Code shall be written in accordance with the interface specifications
presented in design documents and the coding conventions described in 
Section ~\ref{sec:code_conv}.  Code reviews shall be conducted by members 
of the Joint Specification Team.

Each class shall be accompanied by a suite of unit tests.  The user
shall have the option to build either ``sanity check'' type tests or an 
exhaustive suite.  The exhaustive tests will include tests of all
functionalities and a variety of valid and invalid input values. The
sanity tests will be a minumum set of tests to indicate whether, for
example, the software has been installed correctly.  The NASA Computational 
Technologies team will review and supplement the unit tests to ensure 
that software requirements are met.

\subsubsection {System Testing }

System testing and integration shall be performed incrementally on the 
evolving body of ESMF software, in accordance with the {\it Build and Test 
Plan}.  For additional discussion
of test and validation procedures, see Section~\ref{sec:testing}.

\subsection {Release and Iteration }

The tagging convention for public and internal releases is
described in Section~\ref{sec:tagging}.

Major releases shall be accompanied by thorough documentation, including an 
{\it ESMF User's Guide} and {\it ESMF Reference Manual}.  User documentation
shall include code excerpts, examples to demonstrate ideas, existing bugs,
and restrictions. 

ESMF releases shall be announced via mailing lists, on the ESMF
website, and at community meetings.  Source code shall be available
for download from the ESMF website and from the SourceForge site.

At the close of both internal and public release cycles, we plan to 
iterate on requirements, architecture, design, and implementation in 
order to refine and extend the ESMF software and documentation.  The
goal will be to maintain a close-to-deliverable system throughout 
development, with functionality and optimization increasing
over time.

\subsection {Maintenance and Extension} 

Routine maintenance of the framework will include ports to new 
platforms and modifications for new compilers.  Extensions to the 
framework may occur at a wide range of different scales, from adding
a new performance optimization to creating an extensive library
of tools for advanced support of data assimilation systems.  
The version of the {\it ESMF User's Guide} delivered in 
January 2005 will provide instructions for routine extensions of 
the framework -- for example, adding support for an additional grid.
Other extensions to the framework will be facilitated by the system
documentation provided in the {\it User's Guide} and {\it Reference Manual}.
