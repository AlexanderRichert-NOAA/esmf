\section{Supported Platforms}
\label{sec:platforms}

The ESMF core framework and validation suite shall run on the following 
systems:  IBM SP, SGI Origin,
Compaq ES, Cray T3E, Sun Solaris, and Linux systems including clusters,
assuming that the systems are available.
The primary plaform for development, testing and validation shall be 
a Compaq ES.  Regression testing will be performed on all target 
platforms throughout development.

Members of our collaboration are not currently running codes regularly 
on vector processor-based systems such as those provided by NEC or 
Fujitsu so these platforms are currently a secondary priority.

The primary platforms for JMC codes to be delivered for ESMF
milestones are Compaq ES, IBM SP, SGI Origin, and Linux 
clusters.
