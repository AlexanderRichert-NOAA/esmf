\section{Software Development Cycle}
\label{sec:app_life_cycle}

Since the JMC codes exist as mature software products already, the 
development sequence pertains not to these applications themselves 
but to ESMF-compliant versions of the applications.  Like the core 
framework development effort, development of 
application components is based on the staged delivery 
model, as described in Section~\ref{sec:life_cycle}.  This will be
customized as appropriate for component developers.  For example,
we will not require component developers to supply a suite of 
unit tests, as will be required for the core framework.  However,
we will expect exhaustive system testing for components prior to 
delivery.
