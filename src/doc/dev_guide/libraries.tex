\section{External Software Libraries}
\label{sec:lib}

The external utilities and libraries that the ESMF 
distribution relies on are listed on the {\bf Downloads \&
Documentation} page of the ESMF website.  None of them are 
currently included in the ESMF source.

As appropriate, the section will describe how such libraries will be
updated and if and how, on a case-by-case basis, they will be 
included in the ESMF source.
