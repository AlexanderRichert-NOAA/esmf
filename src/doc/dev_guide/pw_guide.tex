This part of the {\it Guide} outlines practices relating to the entire
ESMF project.

\section{Communication}

\subsection{Communication within the Joint Specification Team}
Written communication amongst the Joint Specification Team relating 
to software development (reviews, comments, etc.) is sent to the mailing list 
esmf\_tech@ucar.edu.  A web archive of this list is accessible to
ESMF developers from the ESMF website.

ESMF Joint Specification Team telecons are held as needed, typically 
on a weekly basis.  In-person meetings occur as needed, typically 
on a quarterly basis.

Feedback from ESMF application groups implementing the framework in their
codes will be provided via the SourceForge tracking system in addition
to email and the other communication mechanisms described in this section.

\subsection{Communication with the Community} 
The ESMF project shall have open meetings with the community on roughly a 
yearly basis, during late spring.  Initially these meetings will focus
on requirements collection and API reviews.  As the project evolves,
meeting topics will shift to framework usage and extension.  
On-line forms for community input shall be provided as appropriate on 
the ESMF website.  Community members with general questions 
are encouraged to write to:
\begin{center}
\htmladdnormallink{esmf@ucar.edu}{mailto:esmf@ucar.edu}
\end{center}
Interactions with the community during specific life cycle stages
are detailed in the sections describing those stages.

Community members who are interested in keeping abreast of ESMF progress
can join the mailing list:
\begin{center}
\htmladdnormallink{esmf\_info@ucar.edu}{mailto:esmf\_info@ucar.edu}
\end{center}

Subscribers to this list receive monthly newletters describing ESMF 
achievements and events.  To subscribe on-line, visit the {\bf User 
Support \& Contacts} link on the ESMF website.

Support questions should be directed to:
\begin{center}
\htmladdnormallink{esmf\_support@ucar.edu}{mailto:esmf\_support@ucar.edu}
\end{center}

The {\bf User Support \& Contacts} link on the ESMF website describes
how to submit an effective support request and outlines the ESMF support
policy.

\subsection{Communication with the NASA Computational Technologies Team}
The NASA Computational Technologies (CT) Team is responsible for
evaluating whether the products and actvities of the ESMF team satisfy
project milestones.  The ESMF technical leads hold teleconferences as
necessary with members of the NASA CT team to address any outstanding issues.

\section{Collaborative Development Environment}

The ESMF is registered as a project on the SourceForge 
open source development site, at:
\begin{center}
\htmladdnormallink{{\bf http://sourceforge.net/projects/esmf}}{http://sourceforge.net/projects/esmf}
\end{center}

The SourceForge site is also accessible from the ESMF website,
via either the {\bf Development} link or the {\it SourceForge}
logo on the navigation bar.

The ESMF project uses SourceForge for
\begin{itemize}
\item hosting and browsing a common CVS repository; 
\item maintaining test and task lists;
\item archiving mailing lists;
\item providing tarballs of public source code releases (releases
      are also made available on the ESMF website);
\item tracking bugs; and 
\item tracking support requests.
\end{itemize}
