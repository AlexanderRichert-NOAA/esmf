This part of the {\it Guide} outlines practices relating to the entire
ESMF project.

\section{Communication}

\subsection{Communication within the Joint Specification Team}
Written communication amongst the Joint Specification Team (JST) relating 
to software development (reviews, comments, etc.) shall be sent to
the mailing list esmf\_jst@ucar.edu.  A web archive of this list
is accessible to ESMF developers from the ESMF website.  ESMF JST
telecons are held as needed, typically on a weekly basis.  In-person
meetings occur as needed, typically on a yearly basis.

\subsection{Communication with the Community} 
The ESMF project shall have open meetings with the community on roughly a 
yearly basis, during late spring.  

Interactions with the community during specific life cycle stages
are detailed in the sections describing those stages.

Community members who are interested in keeping abreast of ESMF progress
can join the mailing list:
\begin{center}
\htmladdnormallink{esmf\_info@ucar.edu}{mailto:esmf\_info@ucar.edu}
\end{center}

Subscribers to this list receive occasional newletters describing ESMF 
achievements and events.  To subscribe on-line, visit the {\bf User 
Support \& Community} link on the ESMF website.

Support questions should be directed to:
\begin{center}
\htmladdnormallink{esmf\_support@ucar.edu}{mailto:esmf\_support@ucar.edu}
\end{center}

The {\bf User Support \& Contacts} link on the ESMF website describes
how to submit an effective support request and outlines the ESMF support
policy.

\section{Collaborative Development Environment}

The ESMF is registered as a project on the SourceForge 
open source development site, at:
\begin{center}
\htmladdnormallink{{\bf http://sourceforge.net/projects/esmf}}{http://sourceforge.net/projects/esmf}
\end{center}

The SourceForge site is also accessible from the ESMF website,
via either the {\bf Development} link or the {\it SourceForge}
logo on the navigation bar.

The ESMF project uses SourceForge for
\begin{itemize}
\item hosting and browsing a common CVS repository; 
\item maintaining test and task lists;
\item archiving mailing lists;
\item providing tarballs of public source code releases (releases
      are also made available on the ESMF website);
\item tracking bugs; and 
\item tracking support requests.
\end{itemize}
