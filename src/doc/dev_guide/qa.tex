\section{Quality Assurance}
\label{sec:qa}

Collective public reviews and the intelligence and attentiveness of
project staff are the two primary mechanisms for software quality assurance.  

Requirements, design, code, and project documents such as plans
are subject to public review.  The purpose of the reviews is
to look for inconsistencies, errors, inefficiencies, and areas
for improvement, and to increase coordination and awareness within
the ESMF project.

The Integrator on the core team ensures that support requests
and bugs are reported, tracked, and resolved, and that automated
test and backup scripts are operating correctly.

The Core Team Manager works with team to ensure that documentation
is sufficient, tracks consistency between documentation and source
code before releases, and monitors conformance to coding and
documentation standards.  The Core Team Manager is also responsible
for ensuring the quality and accuracy of the ESMF source code
distribution overall, through the implementation and documentation of
development, test, and release procedures.
