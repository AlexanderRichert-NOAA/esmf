\section{Groups and Roles}

\subsection{Groups Involved in ESMF Development}

For more detail on the groups below, including their Terms of
Reference, see the {\it ESMF Project Plan}.

\subsection{Core Team}
ESMF software implementation is led by a {\bf Core Team} based in the 
Scientific Computing Division (SCD) of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  The Core Team relies on close interaction
with customers, and the work of many contributors.  Core Team
activities are open to active ESMF developers.

\subsection{Joint Specification Team (JST)}
The Core Team, along with contributors, customers, technical
managers, and other stakeholders in development, are collectively
referred to as the {\bf ESMF Joint Specification Team}, or {\bf JST}.  
JST membership is open to members of the science, computing, and
related communities.

\subsection{Change Review Board (CRB)}
ESMF development priorities and schedules are set by a 
{\bf Change Review Board}. or {\bf CRB} that consists of individuals
associated with major ESMF initiatives and applications.  
Members of the CRB are chosen by the ESMF Executive Management.

\subsection{Quality Assurance Responsibilities}

Collective public reviews and the intelligence and attentiveness of
project staff are the two primary mechanisms for software quality assurance.  

Requirements, design, code, and project documents such as plans
are subject to public review.  The purpose of the reviews is
to look for inconsistencies, errors, inefficiencies, and areas
for improvement, and to increase coordination and awareness within
the ESMF project.

The Integrator on the core team ensures that support requests
and bugs are reported, tracked, and resolved, and that automated
test and backup scripts are operating correctly.

The Core Team Manager works with team to ensure that documentation
is sufficient, tracks consistency between documentation and source
code before releases, and monitors conformance to coding and
documentation standards.  The Core Team Manager is also responsible
for ensuring the quality and accuracy of the ESMF source code
distribution overall, through the implementation and documentation of
development, test, and release procedures.
