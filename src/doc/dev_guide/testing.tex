\subsection{Testing and Validation}
\label{sec:testing}

ESMF software is subject to the following tests:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Unit tests, which are simple per-class tests.
\item System tests, which generally involve inter-component interactions.
\item Use test cases (UTCs), which are tests at realistic problem
sizes (e.g., large data sets, processor counts, grids).
\item Examples that range from simple to complex.
\end{enumerate}
Unit tests, system tests, and examples are distributed with the
ESMF software.  Use test cases, because of their size, are 
stored and distributed separately.  Tests are run nightly,
following a weekly schedule, on a wide variety of platforms.  

The ESMF team keeps track of test coverage on a per-method basis.
This information is on the {\bf Metrics} page under the {\bf Development}
link on the navigation bar.

Testing information is stored on a {\bf Test and Validation} webpage,
under the {\bf Development} link on the ESMF 
website.  This webpage includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item separate webpages for each system test and UTC;
\item links to the {\it Developer's Guide}, SourceForge Tracker, Requirements 
Spreadsheet, and any other pertinent information; and
\item separate webpage for automated regression test information and results.
\end{itemize}

The ESMF is designed to run on several target platforms, in different 
configurations, and is required to interoperate with many combinations 
of application software. Thus our test strategy includes the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Tests shall be executed on as many target platforms as possible. 
\item Tests shall be executed on a variety of programming paradigms
(e.g pure shared memory, pure distributed memory and a mix of both).
\item Tests shall be executed in multiple configurations (e.g. uni-processor,
multi-processor).
\item The result of each test is a {\tt PASS/FAIL}.  
\item In some cases, for floating point comparisons, an epsilon value
will be used.
\item Unit tests will be implemented for each language interface that is 
supported.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Unit Tests}

Each class in the framework is associated with a suite of unit tests.
Typically the unit tests are stored in one file per class, and are
located near the corresponding source code in a test directory.  The 
framework {\tt make} system will have an option to build and run unit tests.
The user has the option of building either a "sanity check" type test
or an exhaustive suite. The exhaustive tests include tests of many 
functionalities and a variety of valid and invalid input values. The sanity 
tests are a minumum set of tests to indicate whether, for example, the 
software has been installed correctly. It is the responsiblity of the 
software developer to write and execute the unit tests. Unit tests 
are distributed with the framework software.

To achieve adequate unit testing, developers shall attempt to meet the following goals. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Individual procedures will be evaluated with at least one unit
test function.  However, as many test functions as necessary will be
implemented to assure that each procedure works properly.  
\item Developers will unit test their code to the degree possible  
before it is checked into the repository.  It is assumed that 
developers will use stubs as necessary.
\item Variables will be tested for acceptable range and precision.
\item Variables will be tested for a range of valid values, including boundary
values.
\item Unit tests will verify that error handling works correctly.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{System Tests}

System tests are written to test functionality that spans several 
classes.  The following areas are given special
consideration during our system testing.

\begin{itemize}
\item Design omissions (e.g. incomplete or incorrect behaviors).
\item Associations between objects (e.g. fields, grids, bundles).
\item Control and Infrastructure. (e.g. couplers, time management, error handling).
\item Feature interactions or side effects when multiple features are used
simultaneously.
\item Compatibility between previously working software releases and new releases.
\item Different behaviors among different platforms.
\item Language interfaces.
\end{itemize}

The system tester shall issue a test log after each software release is tested,
which shall be recorded on the {\bf Test and Validation} webpage. The test 
log shall
include: a test ID number, a software release ID number, testing environment 
descriptions, a list of test cases executed, results, and any unexpected 
events. Bugs will be documented in the \htmladdnormallink{{\it SourceForge Bug 
Tracker}}{https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group\_id=38089&atid=421185} and 
any bug fixes shall be validated.

\subsubsection{Use Test Cases (UTCs)}

\subsubsection{Automated Regression Tests}

The purpose of regression testing is to reveal faults caused by new
or modified software (e.g. side effects, incompatibility between 
releases, and bad bug fixes).  
The regression tests will regularly exercise all interfaces of the code on 
all target platforms.  The gatekeeper (see Section~\ref{sec:cm}) runs 
automated nightly builds on a wide variety of machines, listed on the
{\bf Test and Validation} website. 
Log files of the build results are stored at {\tt /fs/projects/css/esmf/esmf\_test/daily\_builds} on the NCAR fileserver. 
The log files are kept on a monthly basis in 
separate directories. For example, the December 2002 directory is named {\tt 0212\_test}. The 
directory contains an {\tt ESMFdailyLog} file which has a one line entry for each platform on 
which the build was attempted indicating whether the build was successful or not. 

The \htmladdnormallink{{\tt ESMFdailyLog}}
{https://www.esmf.ucar.edu/test/daily\_test/ESMFdailyLog} file for the current month is available on the {\bf Test and Validation} website.

If the build is not successful, then a file containing the build output is stored in 
the {\tt /fs/projects/css/esmf/esmf\_test/daily\_builds} directory on the NCAR fileserver. The file naming convention for the build output file is 
{\tt build\_BOPT\_(day)(platform)ESMF\_ARCH}. For example, if the build fails on longs on the 19th of the month with {\tt BOPT=g}, the file would be called {\tt build\_g\_19longslinux\_lf95}. 

Email is sent daily to the ESMF core team listing all the platforms on which the build was attempted with a {\tt PASS/FAIL} indication. 

\subsection{Internal Releases}

ESMF software is released in a beta form, as an Internal Release,
three months before it is publicly released.  This gives users
a chance to test the software and report back any problems to 
support.

\subsection{Software Release Test Procedures}

We provide two types of tar files, the ESMF source and the shared libraries of 
the supported platforms. Consequently, there are two test procedures followed before placing the 
tar files on the ESMF download website. 

\subsubsection{Source Code Test Procedure}

This procedure is followed on all the supported platforms for the particular release.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Verify that the source code builds in both {\tt BOPT=g} and {\tt BOPT=O}.
\item Verify that  the {\tt ESMF\_COUPLED\_FLOW} demonstration executes successfully.
\item Verify that the unit tests run successfully, and that there are no {\tt NON-EXHAUSTIVE} unit tests  failures.
\item Verify that all system tests run successfully. 
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Shared Libraries Test Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Change to the {\tt CoupledFlowEx} directory and execute {\tt gmake}. Verify that the demo runs successfully.
\item Change to the {\tt CoupledFlowSrc} directory and execute {\tt gmake} then {\tt gmake run}. Verify that the demo runs successfully.
\item Change to the {\tt examples} directory and execute {\tt gmake} and {\tt gmake run}. Verify that the example runs successfully.
\end{enumerate}
