\section{Quality Assurance}
\label{sec:app_qa}

As described in Section~\ref{sec:qa}, requirements documents, design 
and architecture documents, code including
test scripts, code documentation, the {\it Build and Test Plan}, system test
results, and this {\it Developer's Guide} and the procedures specified
therein shall be reviewed by appropriate members of the Joint Specification 
Team.  

The integrator/gatekeeper on the Core Team shall serve as an independent
quality assurance lead for JMC applications.

The quality assurance lead:
\begin{itemize}
\item tracks consistency between documentation and source code for
      application component interfaces before releases;
\item ensures that the manner in which the code was adapted for ESMF 
      is fully documented (this is likely to be through configuration 
      management records and not a report);
\item ensures that validation tests are executed for each application; 
\item ensures that problem reports are written and entered into the 
      Core Team tracking system when problems arise integrating ESMF 
      into applications;
\item verifies that problems are resolved and the tracker updated;
\item ensures that build, test and install procedures exist and are documented, can run
   on multiple platforms and with multiple different processor configurations;
\item ensures that the deployment demonstration applications are publically available on the
   web and are maintained in consistency with the owning institutions
   development efforts;
\item ensures that the general documentation guidelines as specified in 
Section 2.1.2 of this document are followed.   
\end{itemize}
