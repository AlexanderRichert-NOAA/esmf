\section{The ESMF Application Programming Interface}

The ESMF Application Programming Interface (API) is based on the
object-oriented programming notion of a {\bf class}.  A class is a 
software construct that's used for grouping a set of related variables 
together with the subroutines and functions that operate on them.  We 
use classes in ESMF because they help to organize the code, and often 
make it easier to maintain and understand.  A particular instance
of a class is called an {\bf object}.  

The Fortran interface is implemented so that the variables associated
with a class are stored in a derived type.  For example, an 
{\tt ESMF\_Field} derived type stores the data array, grid 
information, and metadata associated with a physical field.
The derived type for each class is stored in a Fortran module, and 
the operations associated with each class are defined as module
procedures.  We use the Fortran features of generic functions and
optional arguments extensively to simplify our interfaces.

The modules for ESMF are bundled together and can be accessed with a 
single {\tt USE} statement, {\tt USE ESMF\_Mod}.

\subsection{Standard Methods and Interface Rules}

ESMF defines a set of standard methods and interface rules that
hold across the entire API.  These are: 

\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt <Class>\_Create()} and {\tt <Class>\_Destroy()}, for creating and 
destroying classes.  The {\tt <Class>\_Create()} method allocates memory 
for the class structure itself and for internal variables, and
initializes variables as appropriate.  It is always written as a 
Fortran function that returns a derived type instance of the class.

\item {\tt <Class>\_Set()} and {\tt <Class>\_Get()}, for setting and 
retrieving a particular item or flag.  In general, these methods are
overloaded for all cases where the item can be manipulated as a
name/value pair.  If identifying the item requires more than a 
name, or if the object is of sufficient complexity that overloading
in this way would result in an overwhelming number of options, we 
define specific {\tt <Class>\_Set<Something>} and 
{\tt <Class>\_Get<Something>} interfaces.

\item {\tt <Class>\_Add()}, {\tt <Class>\_Get()}, and 
{\tt <Class>\_Remove()} for manipulating 
items that can be appended or inserted into a list of like
items within a class.  For example, the {\tt State\_AddField()}
method adds another Field to the list of Fields contained
in the State class.

\item {\tt <Class>\_Print()}, for printing the contents of a class to 
standard out.  This method is mainly intended for debugging.

\item {\tt <Class>\_ReadRestart()} and {\tt <Class>\_WriteRestart}, 
for saving the contents of a class and restoring it exactly.

\item {\tt <Class>\_Validate()}, for determining whether a class is 
internally consistent.  For example, {\tt Field\_Validate} checks 
whether the Array and Grid associated with a Field are consistent.

\end{itemize}

{\bf EXAMPLE}

In this simple example, an ESMF Field is created with the 
name {\tt 'temp'}.  

\begin{verbatim}

USE ESMF_Mod

type ESMF_Field :: field

field = ESMF_FieldCreate('temp')

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Special Methods}

The following methods are special methods which, in one case,
are required by any application using ESMF, and in the 
other case must be called by any application that is using 
ESMF Components.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt ESMF\_Initialize} and {\tt ESMF\_Finalize} are required 
methods that must bracket the use of ESMF within an application.  
They manage the resources required to run ESMF and shut it down
gracefully.

\item {\tt <Type>Comp\_Initialize}, {\tt <Type>Comp\_Run}, and 
{\tt <Type>Comp\_Finalize} are Component methods that are used at the 
highest level within ESMF.  {\tt <Type>} may be {\tt <Grid>}, for 
Gridded Components such as oceans or atmospheres, or
{\tt <Cpl>}, for Coupler Components that are used to connect 
them.  The content of these methods is not part of the ESMF.  
Instead the methods call into associated Fortran subroutines within 
user code.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{The ESMF Data Hierarchy}

The ESMF API is organized around an hierarchy of five classes that 
contain model field data.  The operations that are performed
on model field data, such as regridding, redistribution, and halo 
updates, are accessed through these classes.  

The main data classes in ESMF, in order of increasing complexity, are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Array} An ESMF Array is a distributed, multi-dimensional 
array that can carry information such as its type, kind, rank, and 
associated halo widths.  It contains a reference to a native Fortran array.
\item {\bf Field}  A Field represents a physical scalar or vector field.
It contains a reference to an Array along with grid information and metadata.
\item {\bf Bundle}  A Bundle is a collection of Fields discretized 
on the same grid.  The staggering of data points may be different for 
different Fields within a Bundle.
\item {\bf State}  A State represents the collection of data that a 
Component either requires to run (an Import State) or can make 
available to other Components (an Export State).
States may contain references to Bundles, Fields, or Arrays. 
\item {\bf Component}  A Component is a substantial piece of software 
with a distinct function.  ESMF currently recognizes two types 
of Components.  Components that represent a physical domain 
or process, such 
as an atmospheric model, are called Gridded Components since they are 
usually discretized on an underlying grid.  The Components 
responsible for regridding and transferring data between Gridded 
Components are called Coupler Components.  Each Component
is associated with an Import and an Export State.  Components
can be nested so that simpler components and applications can 
be used to compose more complex applications.

\end{itemize}

Underlying these data classes are native language arrays.  ESMF allows 
you to reference an existing Fortran array to an ESMF Array, 
Field, or Bundle, so that ESMF data classes can be readily 
introduced into existing code.  You can perform communication operations 
directly on Fortran arrays through the DELayout class, which serves 
as a unifying wrapper for distributed and shared memory communication 
libraries.

\subsection{ESMF Spatial Classes}

Like the hierarchy of model data classes, ranging from the 
simple to the complex, the ESMF is organized around an hierarchy of 
classes that represent different spaces associated with a computation.
Each of these spaces can be indexed in some fashion, in order to give
the user control over how a computation is executed.  For Earth system
applications, this hierarchy spans the environment associated with the 
computer to the physical region described by the application.  
The main spatial classes in ESMF, in order of those closest to the
machine to those closest to the application, are:

\begin{itemize}

\item The {\bf Virtual Machine}, or {\bf VM} The ESMF VM is an 
abstraction of a parallel computing environment that encompasses 
both shared and distributed memory.  Its primary purpose 
is resource allocation.  Each Component defines its own VM based on 
the resources it desires.  The elements of a VM are {\bf Persistent 
Execution Threads}, or {\bf PETs}.  A simple case is one in which 
every PET is associated with an MPI process running on a separate
processor.  If Components are nested, the parent component allocates 
a subset of its PETs to its children.  The children have some flexibility, 
subject to the constraints of the computing environment, to decide 
how they want to use the PETs they've received.

\item {\bf DELayout}  A DELayout represents a decomposition.  Its
basic elements are {\bf Decomposition Elements}, or {\bf DEs}.  
A DELayout associates a set of DEs and a topology - how the DEs 
are connected - with the PETs in a VM.  The user can also define 
communication weights between DEs, for use in load balancing.
DEs are not necessarily one-to-one with PETs.  For cache blocking,
or user-managed multi-threading, more DEs than PETs may be defined.
Fewer DEs than PETs may be defined if an application requires,
for example, a decomposition that is an integer multiple.

\item {\bf Grid}  A Grid is an abstraction of a physical space.  
It associates a coordinate system, a set of coordinates, and 
a topology to a collection of grid cells. 

\item {\bf Field}  A Field may contain more dimensions than the 
Grid that it is discretized on.  For example, for convenience 
during integration, a user may want to define a single Field object 
that holds snapshots of the data at multiple times.  The Field 
must track what these additional dimensions mean.  Fields also 
keep track of the location of a Field data point within its 
associated Grid cell.

\end{itemize}

Although it is not an ESMF class, the linear {\bf address space} 
of the computer is another fundamental index space that must be 
mapped to data stored by the ESMF system.  

In order to map between the index spaces of all of these classes,
we require either implicit rules (in which case the relationship 
between index spaces is defined by default), or interfaces that 
allow the user to specify the desired association.  The mechanisms
within ESMF for defining these associations are:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf VM to DELayout} The DELayout provides interfaces and 
shortcuts that map between its DEs and the PETs defined in the 
VM.

\item {\bf DELayout to Grid} The Grid provides interfaces that map 
between the index space defined by its coordinates and the decomposition 
described by the DELayout.

\item {\bf Grid, Array, and Field} The DataMap class maps between 
an Array and a Grid.  It defines the relationships between their
index spaces as well as any additional dimensions defined by the Field.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{ESMF Specification Classes}

At various places in the ESMF, it is useful to make neat packets
of descriptive parameters.  Some of these are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt IOSpec}, for storing IO parameters.
\item {\tt ArraySpec}, for storing the specifics, such as type/kind/rank,
of an array.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ESMF Utility Classes}

There are a number of utilities in ESMF that can be used independently.
These are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt TimeMgr}, for calendar, date, clock and alarm functions.
\item {\tt LogErr}, for logging and error handling.
\item {\tt Config}, for creating resource files that can replace namelists
as a consistent way of setting configuration parameters.
\end{itemize}
