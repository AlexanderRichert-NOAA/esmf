\section{Overall Design and Implementation Notes}

\begin{enumerate}

\item All ESMF classes are built upon a Base class.  The Base is used to hold 
system-wide capabilities, such as Attributes.

\item Attributes are implemented in the Base class so they can be attached to
any object in the system which is built on the Base object.  (This is true
for all deep objects in the system.)  Attributes are created by making a
private copy of the information provided during the Set call.  Lists of
values are supported, but they are not intended for large
data arrays.   Data is also copied during a Get operation.

\end{enumerate}
