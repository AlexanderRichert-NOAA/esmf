\req{Superstructure Level Issues}
\sreq{Arbitrary SPMD and MPMD support}
The {\it Control} layer in ESMF is required to manage arbitrary collections
of SPMD and MPMD programs running across a potentially heterogeneous
mix of platforms.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Potential Imapact:} Serious \\
{\bf Problem Likelihood:} Low \\
{\bf Action Being Taken:} ed-1. \\
{\bf Fix:} Milestone demonstrations.\\
{\bf Notes:} Some form of component versioning, labeling and naming
is required that enables experiment configuration logs
to include information of which components were used.
\end{reqlist}

\req{System Issues}
\sreq{Interoperation between languages}
ESMF will use a mix of Fortran, C and C++
\sreq{F90 Continued Availability}
Fortran 90/95 remain {\it fringe} languages, even though most of the Earth system
community uses them. Two consequences of this are that ESMF Fortran 90 code will
rely on vendor supplied compilers that have an ever decreasing user base and
that there is no true open-source compiler for Fortran 90/95.
This impacts ESMF directly because some of its code will use F90 and
indirectly because many of its components exist in F90 only.
\begin{reqlist}
{\bf Potential Imapact:} Serious \\
{\bf Problem Likelihood:} Low\\
{\bf Action Being Taken:} Some framework development is being pursued in C/C++\\
{\bf Fix:} Entire framework would need to be in C/C++.\\
{\bf Notes:} Reimplementation in C/C++ would be time-consuming but
otherwise straightforward. For components the impact would be far more
serious, but this is outside the scope of ESMF.
Components in Fortran 77, C and C++ would not be affected by lack of 
compiler availability as compilers exist almost all hardware for these languages.
