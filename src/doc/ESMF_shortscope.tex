\subsection{Scope of the ESMF}

The ESMF includes 1) services and standards for coupling high-level model components,
and 2) an infrastructure of general utilities for composing model components.  The model
components we will support initially are those included in the ESMF {\it Joint Milestone Codeset}, 
or JMC.  The JMC consists of climate, weather and data assimilation codes developed by 
ESMF investigators and their colleagues (see \htmladdnormallink
{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu/main\_site/resources}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu/main\_site/resources}).  
These include regional and global atmospheres, regional and global oceans, land models, 
sea ice models, and data assimilation 
systems.  Each model component will need to recode or wrap its internal data structures in 
order to provide a standard ESMF interface and employ ESMF inter-component communications.  
The ESMF coupling services will include software for representing data distributions, 
interpolating and redistributing gridded data, and load balancing computations.

Coupling services will be built upon a base of general data structures and utilities.  Supporting the coupling services and accessible to model developers are a set of 
general ESMF utilities.  These include error handling, timing and profiling, 
message logging, low-level I/O and communication, time management, and parameter 
specification.
