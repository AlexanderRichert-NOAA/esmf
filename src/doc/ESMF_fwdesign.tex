\section{Framework-Wide Design Elements}
\label{sec:fwdesign}

The following sections describe design choices that apply across the 
entire body of ESMF software.

\subsection{ESMF Base Object (ESMF\_Base)}
\label{sec:esmfbase}

\label{sec:Base} 
All ESMF objects inherit from an ESMF {\tt Base} class.  
The {\tt Base} class is an abstraction of the data and behavior common to all
classes in the framework.  Some methods and data can be
inherited directly; others are expected to be overloaded by
higher level objects.  {\tt Base} class methods include setting and querying attributes,
print, validate, read/write, and restart.
