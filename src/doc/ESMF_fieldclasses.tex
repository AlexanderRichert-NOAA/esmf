\section{Infrastructure: Fields and Grids}
\label{sec:fieldclasses}

\subsection{Introduction}

The Infrastructure layer of the ESMF system contains both lower
level utility routines and higher level data handling objects.
This section discusses the data objects and how they relate to
the rest of the ESMF library and to user-supplied code.  
See Section~\ref{utilclasses} for a discussion of the utility layer.

The data object layer of ESMF is called by user-supplied code
as in a conventional software library, unlike the framework model
of the Superstructure layer.
Some hardware details are discernable at the data object layer, 
but in general it presents a portable, generalized interface to the
data objects.
This helps satisfy the overall ESMF goals of ease of use and
performance portability.

Many model components follow a data-parallel model for running
concurrently on multiprocessor hardware.
The data layer provides an abstraction which
minimizes the dependency of the user-supplied code on 
how the decomposition maps to the underlying hardware
capabilities.  


\subsection{Overview}

The major data objects are Bundles,
Fields, Physical Grids, Distributed Grids, and Data Arrays.
The Physical Grid carries global coordinate information and grid type,
the Distributed Grid manages decomposition information, 
the Data Array carries the actual
data values, and Fields and Bundles tie them together.

The Field level is the highest functional data access level in the ESMF library.
The Field object connects computational Data objects, the underlying
physical and distributed Grid objects, optional Mask objects and IOspec
objects, and metadata Attribute objects.  
It provides methods
for setting, retrieving, configuring, and querying these subobjects,
as well as methods for manipulating the relationship between the
data and the grid, and for doing data I/O. 
% It provides methods to query global information about a dataset, 
% get coordinate and topology information, and 
% get a pointer to the start of a data subset for local processing. 
The Field object uses information from the Grid object to provide
two different types of views of the field to the calling code.
One is a unified logical view of the entire Field as a whole,
regardless of the current decomposition.  The other view allows code
running on a single processing element to query and retrieve a pointer 
to the subset of the Field which is local to that processing element,
and to make requests that result in data being updated among neigboring
subsets (e.g. Halo updates).

The Bundle object collects multiple Field objects which share a
common or compatible Grid object.  In addition to methods for
setting, retrieving, and querying the constituent Fields, it provides
methods for configuring and querying memory layouts for the Data objects
and some limited operations on all Fields in a Bundle.

A Physical Grid object is responsible for
maintaining information about the global coordinates.
A Distributed Grid maintains and manages
the decomposition of the whole problem is spread across multiple
processing elements.  << this needs more details, but how
much and at what level?  various possible grid types, etc?? nsc. >> 

A Data object is responsible for maintaining
information about the individual value type (e.g. float, integer), 
the physical representation (e.g. Cray format float vs IEEE), the 
individual data item length (e.g. scalar, vector, vector length), 
data count, and memory ordering information such as Fortran vs C order 
for multidimensional arrays.  Data objects can be homogeneous or
contain heterogeneous data values, for example if supporting
packed data for a Bundle object.
The Data objects utilize an Ordering object to store the
memory layout information and to manage memory reordering requests.
If the data are packed, the Ordering object maintains the information
about the order of the Fields in the single data array.
Data methods include querying the various information about the
data, returning a pointer to the start of the data
array, and methods for reordering and subsetting the data.

\subsection{Class Details}

Gridded Components encapsulate the computational data and the
grid on which it is located.  A Gridded Component contains
the following object hierarchy:

\scalebox{0.70}{\includegraphics{ESMF_DataStructureHierarchy.eps}}


\subsubsection{Bundle (ESMF\_Bundle)}
\label{sec:bundle} 
\begin{description}
\item [Description] A Bundle contains one or more Fields which are defined on the
same Grid.  It allows the application to manipulate multiple fields in an identical
manner with a single set of calls.  It also allows the option of interleaving data
from multiple fields into a single Data Array for more efficient memory access patterns.
\item [Function] The Bundle class is an aggregation of the Field class.  It provides methods 
for getting and setting fields.  It provides methods for querying information about the
underlying grid.  It provides methods for requesting the packing of data, the
reordering of that packed data, and detaching and attaching the data.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Field (ESMF\_Field)}
\label{sec:field} 
\begin{description} 
\item [Description] A Field represents a single physical field or the components of a 
vector field.  It is the basic data carrying object in the system.  It includes both
the data and the grid on which the data are defined.  The main application interfaces
for accessing data are here.
\item [Function] The Field object is a composition of the Data Array object, an optional
Mask object, an optional IOspec object, and it aggregates a Grid object.  It provides
methods for getting, setting, and querying the data array, the grid, the mask and
the I/O spec.  It provides methods for detaching and attaching data from the field.
While data are detached it is the responsibility of the application.  A Field object
provides methods for subsetting, regridding, and reordering memory layout of data.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Mask (ESMF\_Mask)}
\label{sec:mask} 
\begin{description}
\item [Description] A Mask describes a subset of data items, for example to indicate
the valid values which represent ocean points (and not land) in an ocean model.  
It may be specified at the Grid object level, but it is stored below the Field level 
for effiency of computation.
\item [Function] The Mask class is an optional part of a Field class.  It provides methods
for getting and setting valid values.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Data Array (ESMF\_Data)}
\label{sec:dataarray} 
\begin{description}
\item [Description] A Data Array is a list of data values plus information about
the data values.
\item [Function] The Data class contains the data as well as information 
about the data, including the data type (e.g. float,
integer), the machine type (e.g. IEEE float, Cray float), 
data count, data dimensionality (e.g. scalar, vector).  
It provides methods for querying information about the data,
returning a pointer to the memory location of the start of the data, 
and conversion routines for altering the characteristics of the data.  
Information about how the data array is laid
out in memory is managed by the Ordering class.

Data Arrays can contain either homogeneous or composite data types 
(e.g records or structures).
Data Arrays can be associated with a Field object or with a Bundle object.
Data associated with a Field object consist of only a single variable.  
Data associated
with a Bundle object can have data from multiple Fields packed into a single
buffer with the items interleaved in memory.  
The application may use a packed array to increase
locality of reference while iterating the array, 
or for ease in subsetting multiple data values in one operation.
Information about the multi-field packing and methods to reorder the
data are managed by the Ordering class.

\end{description}

\subsubsection{Ordering (ESMF\_Ordering)}
\label{sec:ordering} 
\begin{description}
\item [Description] A Ordering is the description of how multidimentional data have been
linearized in memory.  This includes multidimensional array index information (e.g. C-order
vs Fortran-order), vector or tensor data item ordering information (e.g. all Xs then all
Ys vs [X,Y], [X,Y] tuples), and for Arrays associated with a Bundle object which contain
data for multiple fields, interleave information about how multiple field data are 
packed into a single buffer.
\item [Function] An Ordering object is associated with a single Data object.  It provides
methods to query the current memory organization and methods to reorder the Data object.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Grid (ESMF\_Grid)}
\label{sec:ordering} 
\begin{description}
\item [Description] A Grid is the general representation of the coordinate information for
the computation.  It contains both the logical presentation of the grid as well as the
decomposition of the grid into subgrids for processing in parallel on a
multiprocessor system.
\item [Function] The Grid class is the composition of a PhysGrid and a DistGrid object.  
It is aggregated into the Field and the Bundle objects.  It provides methods to the
Field and Bundle classes for obtaining coordinate, indexing, and decomposition information.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Physical Grid (ESMF\_PhysGrid)}
\label{sec:physgrid} 
\begin{description}
\item [Description] A Physical Grid is a discrete representation of a continuous physical space.
There are a multitude of types of physical grids.
The grid contains the physical coordinates, usually indicating where data values are located, but
it could also be a parametric description of the actual locations.  
\item [Function] The PhysGrid class maintains a global index space for coordinate information.
It provides methods for creating a variety of grid types, including both reading grid information
and generating grids from parameters.  It provides methods for regridding, or translating
one grid to another, used for example when exchanging data through the coupler between
various components.
The PhysGrid class does not handle grid decomposition issues related to 
distributed processing; see the Distributed Grid object in Section~\ref{distgrid}.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Distributed Grid (ESMF\_DistGrid)} 
\label{sec:distgrid} 
\begin{description}
\item [Description] A Distributed Grid is a collection of subgrids which
constitute a single logical grid.  The subgrids can be operated on in
parallel on a multiple processor machine.  
\item [Function] The DistGrid class contains the mapping
between the local grid decompositions and the global logical grid. 
It contains methods to 
synchronize data values between the boundaries of subsets, and to
collect and communicate global data values.  It interacts closely with
the Physical Grid object (see Section~\ref{physgrid}).
It uses a Layout object to identify and manage the processing elements 
available for the computation.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Input/Output Specfication (ESMF\_IOspec)}
\label{sec:iospec} 
\begin{description}
\item [Description] A Input/Output specfication contains all information necessary to
read or write objects.  It includes the destination information (e.g. file), the name,
the format, and any format specific parameters needed to complete the I/O.
\item [Function] The IOspec class is ...   << how does this fit?? >>
