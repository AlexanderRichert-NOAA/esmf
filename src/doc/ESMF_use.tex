\subsection{Using the ESMF}
\label{UsingLibrary}

To use ESMF from Fortran, add the directory that contains
the ESMF {\tt *.mod} file(s),

\begin{verbatim}
$ESMF_DIR/mod/mod$ESMF_BOPT/$ESMF_ARCH.$ESMF_COMPILER.$ESMF_PREC.$ESMF_SITE
\end{verbatim} 

to your search path for {\tt *.mod} files.  For most compilers this path 
is identified either with a {\tt -I} or a {\tt -M}.  You must also link 
with the ESMF library.  For most compilers, adding the {\tt -L} directory 
search flag with the following directory:

\begin{verbatim}
$ESMF_DIR/lib/lib$ESMF_BOPT/$ESMF_ARCH.$ESMF_COMPILER.$ESMF_PREC.$ESMF_SITE
\end{verbatim} 

followed by the {\tt -lesmf} flag, will link in the ESMF library.

More details of how to link on specific platforms are included in the 
next section.

There is a single ESMF module, called {\tt ESMF\_Mod}, that should be 
included in applications with the Fortran {\tt USE} statement.  It 
is not necessary to include any header files in Fortran.

To use ESMF from C/C++, link with the ESMF library 
and include the {\tt ESMC.h} file. 

\subsubsection{Shared Object Libraries}

On some platforms, a shared object library is created in addition to the
standard {\tt .a} library.
Shared object libraries are libraries that are loaded by the first program 
that uses them. All programs that start afterwards automatically use the 
existing shared library. The library is kept in memory as long as any 
active program is still using it. 

Since shared object libraries are pre-linked to system libraries, using them
simplifies life for the user when a variety of system libraries are
required or when system libraries vary a great deal on a 
platform-to-platform basis.  ESMF requires linking to both Fortran90 and
C++ libraries on a set of very non-standardized platforms, and using
shared objects helps to hide some of this complexity.

The order in which shared libraries are presented to 
the linker is important. Library routines must be called before they are 
defined. So, if a library {\bf A} uses functionality provided by library 
{\bf B}, then library {\bf A} must appear before library {\bf B} on the 
link line. 

\subsubsection{Linking}

To link a Fortran90 application to the ESMF libraries please 
refer to the {\tt link\_rules} files found in the following directories:

\begin{verbatim}
	$ESMF_DIR/build_config/AIX.default.default
	$ESMF_DIR/build_config/IRIX64.default.default
	$ESMF_DIR/build_config/Linux.intel.default
	$ESMF_DIR/build_config/Linux.lahey.default
	$ESMF_DIR/build_config/Linux.pgi.default
	$ESMF_DIR/build_config/OSF1.default.default
\end{verbatim}

In an effort to provide platform specific information for building ESMF 
and linking the libraries with your application, a new sourceforge 
site, esmfcontrib, has been created.
To locate the platforms makefiles for specific institutions checkout 
the {\tt build\_config\_files} using the appropriate CVSROOT.
The URL for the esmfcontrib Sourceforge site is:

\begin{verbatim}
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/esmfcontrib/
\end{verbatim}

Additionally, you may checkout all the platforms makefile fragments 
for a particular institution from the esmfcontrib. For example to 
checkout the makefile fragments for the platforms at the
National Center for Atmospheric Research, ncar, change directories to

\begin{verbatim}
 	$ESMF_DIR/build_config
\end{verbatim}

and use the following CVS command:

\begin{verbatim}
	cvs -z3 -d:ext:$username@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/esmfcontrib checkout ncar
\end{verbatim}

The following directories will be checked out:

\begin{verbatim}
	AIX.default.blackforest
	AIX.default.bluesky
	Linux.lahey.longs
\end{verbatim}

To build using these makefiles you must set the environment variable ESMF\_SITE, to blackforest, bluesky, or longs.

At the present time, we have files for the following institutions:

\begin{verbatim}
	anl  - Argonne National Labratories
	cola - Center for Ocean Land and Atmosphere
	gsfc - Goddard Space Flight Center
	ncar - National Center for Atmospheric Research
\end{verbatim}


Users are encouraged to contribute pertinent information to the esmfcontrib respository.
