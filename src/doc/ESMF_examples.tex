\subsection{Running ESMF Examples}
\label{examples}


\subsubsection{Example Source Code}

Example source code for each class is found in the class's example
directory. For example, example source code for the Time Manager class
is found in this directory:

\begin{verbatim}
        ESMF_DIR/src/Infrastructure/TimeMgr/examples/
\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{Building and Running Examples}

The GNU makefile targets {\tt examples} and {\tt examples\_uni} build
and run programs found in a class's examples directory.  After the
examples are built, the {\tt examples} target runs the examples using
multiple processors , while {\tt examples\_uni} runs the examples on
a single processor.

These targets first build the ESMF library.

Run from ESMF\_DIR, this command will build and run all examples on
multiple processors:

\begin{verbatim}
       gmake examples
\end{verbatim}

If the command is run in an example source code directory, then only
the example from that directory will be built and run.  The examples
and output files are created in this directory:

\begin{verbatim}
       ESMF_DIR/examples/examplesESMF_BOPT/ESMF_ARCH.ESMF_PREC.ESMF_SITE/
\end{verbatim}

The name of an output file will begin with the name of the example
that created it followed by .stdout.
