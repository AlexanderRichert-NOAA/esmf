\section{Introduction}

The ESMF is a complex and ambitious 
project.   The scope of Earth science modeling is so broad, and the 
term ``framework'' so ambiguous, that the ESMF name alone provides 
little clarification as to what the ESMF actually {\it is}.  In 
this document, we set about addressing the first wave of questions that 
typically accompany an introduction to the ESMF project.  What will the 
ESMF do for the modeling community?  What kinds of functionality will the ESMF 
include?  What sorts of components will it couple?  Is it associated with 
a standardization effort and if so which interfaces will be 
standardized?  What happens when the initial funding period is over?  
It so happens that these questions can be largely addressed by
describing three types of ``general requirements'': an overall vision 
for the project; a statement of the scope of the project; and a listing 
of requirements that apply to the whole body of ESMF sofware.

The first type of requirement, itemized in the statement of project vision,
is sometimes called a ``business requirement.'' \cite{wiegers}  It 
describes those objectives, however hazy and unquantifiable, whose 
attainment will ultimately lead the 
Earth System Community to assess the ESMF as a success or failure.  The second 
type of requirement, discussed in the statement of project scope, 
describes the infrastructure requirements that the ESMF will fulfill.  Here
we describe the functionality of the ESMF, and specify what capabilities 
the ESMF will {\it not} include.  Finally, we specify a set of functional 
requirements -- some quite specific -- that apply to all ESMF 
software.  These will be referenced in subsequent class requirements 
documents.
