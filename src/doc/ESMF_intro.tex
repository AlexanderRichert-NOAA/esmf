\section{Introduction}

The Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) is a complex and ambitious 
project.  A host of questions have peppered the project from its inception.
What is a framework?  What will the ESMF do for the community?  What 
kinds of functionality will the ESMF include?  In this document, we 
set about addressing the first wave of questions that typically accompany
an introduction to the ESMF project.  This includes .  

In this document we describe three distinct forms of ``general requirements'' 
for the Earth System Modeling Framework.  The first type of requirement
is often called a ``business requirement.''  It describes those objectives,
however hazy and unquantifiable, whose attainment will ultimately lead the 
Earth System Community to assess the ESMF as a success.  The second type
of requirement is what we might consider our general user community 
requirements.  In this section we describe the functional scope of the 
ESMF, and specify what capabilities the ESMF will not include.  Finally, 
we specify a set of functional requirements - some quite specific - that 
apply to the whole body of ESMF software.  These will be referenced in 
class requirements documents.
