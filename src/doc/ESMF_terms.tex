This glossary defines terms used in Earth system modeling to describe 
parallel computer architectures, grids and grid decompositions, and 
numerical and computational methods.  While some of the concepts in 
the glossary may eventually appear as computational objects, many 
will not.  The goal here is not to define a framework design or an 
object model but simply to achieve a common language.

\begin{description}

\item[Accumulator] \label{glos:Accumulator} A facility for collecting and 
  averaging data values.  Generally accumulators are associated with 
  temporal averaging, although they might be associated with 
  other weighted averaging operations.    
  
\item[Address space (ASP)] \label{glos:ASP}A standard term to refer to the memory
  seen by a computer program that it can write to directly using
  simple language primitives. 

\item[Alarm] \label{glos:Alarm} An event that occurs at a particular 
  time (or set of times).  It is like an alarm on a real alarm clock 
  except that in order to determine whether it is "ringing", an alarm 
  is "read" by an explicit application action.
  See also \htmlref{clock}{glos:Clock}.

\item[Addressable node] \label{glos:Anode} A set of processors that are
  capable of addressing the same set of blocks of physical memory.

  entity run as a single executable or set of communicating executables.  
  It typically consists of a set of interacting components.  
  See also \htmlref{component}{glos:Component}.

\item[Background grid] \label{glos:BackGrid} 
  A background grid associates each point in a location stream with a 
  location on a grid. A single grid cell may contain zero or more location 
  stream points. See also \htmlref{location stream}{glos:LocStream}, \htmlref{cell}{glos:Cell}. 

\item[Bundle] \label{glos:Bundle} A bundle refers to a set of fields that 
  are associated with the same physical grid and distributed in a similar 
  fashion across the same physical axes.  Fields within a bundle may be
  staggered differently and may have different dimensions. 
  See also \htmlref{fields}{glos:Field}. 

\item[Calendar interval] \label{glos:CalInt} A period of time specified
  in calendar-based units that may be used to increment or decrement time instants.  
  One year and three months is an example of a calendar interval.  Since 
  mathematical operations involving calendar intervals may be ambiguously 
  defined -- for example, incrementing January 31 in the Gregorian calendar by 
  one month -- default behavior must be carefully specified.  
  See also \htmlref{time instant}{glos:TimeInstant}, \htmlref{time interval}{glos:TimeInterval}.

\item[Cell] \label{glos:Cell} A physical location that is specified by both 
  its extent (vertices) and nominal central location, and is associated with 
  a single integer index value or a set of integer index values ( e.g.
  (i) for 1-d, (i,j) for 2-d, (i,j,k) for 3d ). 
  See also \htmlref{index}{glos:Index}.

\item[Clock] \label{glos:Clock} A clock tracks the passage of time and 
  reports the current time instant, like a real clock.  However, most clocks 
  used in ESMF components have a key difference to a real clock. Clocks 
  in an ESMF component are generally stepped forward by the component, as an 
  explicitly coded time step within the overall component.

  parallel.
