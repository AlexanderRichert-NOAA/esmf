This glossary defines terms used in Earth system modeling to describe 
parallel computer architectures, grids and grid decompositions, and 
numerical and computational methods.  While some of the concepts in 
the glossary may eventually appear as computational objects, many 
will not.  The goal here is not to define a framework design or an 
object model but simply to achieve a common language.

\begin{description}

\item[Accumulator] \label{glos:Accumulator} A facility for collecting and 
  averaging data values.  Generally accumulators are associated with 
  temporal averaging, although they might be associated with 
  other weighted averaging operations.    
  
\item[Address space] \label{glos:ASP}A standard term to refer to the memory
  seen by a computer program that it can write to directly using
  simple language primitives. 

\item[Alarm] \label{glos:Alarm} An event 
  that occurs at a particular time (or set of times).  It is like an
   alarm on a real alarm clock except that in order to determine whether 
it is "ringing", an alarm is "read" by an explicit application action.

\item[Addressable node] \label{glos:Anode} A set of processors that are
  capable of addressing the same set of blocks of physical memory.

\item[Application] \label{glos:Application} A coherent computational 
  entity run 
  as a single executable or set of communicating executables.  It 
  typically consists of a set of interacting components.

\item[Background grid] \label{glos:BackGrid} 
  A background grid associates each point in a location stream with a 
  location on a grid. A single grid cell may contain zero or more location 
  stream points.  

\item[Bundle] \label{glos:Bundle} A bundle refers to a set of fields that 
  are associated with the same physical grid and distributed in a similar 
  fashion across the same physical axes.  Fields within a bundle may be
  staggered differently and may have different dimensions.

\item[Calendar interval] \label{glos:CalInt} A period of time specified
in calendar-based units that may be used to increment or decrement time instants.  
One year and three months is an example of a calendar interval.  Since 
mathematical operations involving calendar intervals may be ambiguously 
defined -- for example, incrementing January 31 in the Gregorian calendar by 
one month -- default behavior must be carefully specified.  

\item[Cell] \label{glos:Cell} A physical location that is specified by both 
  its extent (vertices) and nominal central location, and is associated with 
  a single integer index value or a set of integer index values ( e.g.
  (i) for 1-d, (i,j) for 2-d, (i,j,k) for 3d ).

\item[Clock] \label{glos:Clock} A clock tracks the passage of time and 
reports the current time instant, like a real clock.  However, most clocks 
used in ESMF components have a key difference to a real clock. Clocks 
in an ESMF component are generally stepped forward by the component, as an 
explicitly coded time step within the overall component.

\item[Component] \label{glos:Component} A large-scale computational entity 
  associated with a particular physical process or computational function, 
  such as a land model.  Components may be generic or user-supplied.  
  See also gridded component, coupler component.

\item[Compute resource] \label{glos:CompResource} Something that appears as a
  physical or virtual computer resource. Example of compute resources
  are a CPU, a network connection, a communication API, a protocol, a 
  particular network fabric or a piece of computer memory. 

\item[Coupler component] \label{glos:Coupler}
  A component that includes all data and actions needed to enable 
  communication between two or more other components.

\item[Data dependency] \label{glos:DataDep} The property of a computational
  operator that defines the data indices required to perform
  the computation at a point.  For instance, a forward differencing
  operation in X at $(i,j)$ has a dependency on $(i+1,j)$.

\item[Data transpose] \label{glos:DataTranspose} Rearrangement of data arrays 
  between two distributed grids sharing the same global domain.

\item[Day of year] \label{glos:DayOfYear} The day number in the calendar year. 
January 1 is day 1 of the year. Day of year expressed in a floating point 
format is used to express the day number plus the time of day. 
For example, assuming a Gregorian calendar:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\bf date}              & {\bf day of year} \\
\hline 
10 January 2000, 6Z     & 10.25 \\
31 December 2000, 18Z   & 366.75 
\end{tabular}
