The main product delivered by ESMF is the ESMF library that allows application
developers to write programs based on the ESMF API. However, in addition to the
programming library, ESMF distributions come with a set of applications that are
of general interest to the ESMF community. These applications utilize the ESMF
library to implement features such as printing general information about the
ESMF installation, or generating regrid weight files. The provided ESMF
applications are intented to be used as standard command line tools.

The bundled ESMF applications are built and installed during the usual ESMF
installation process, which is described in detail in the ESMF User's Guide. 
After the installation the applications will be located in the binary directory
that was specified during the installation. The exact installation specific
path is available to the user via the {\tt esmf.mk} mechanism in form of the
Makefile variable {\tt ESMF\_APPSDIR}. The ESMF User's Guide discusses the
{\tt esmf.mk} mechanism in more detail.

The following sections provide in-depth documentation of the bundled ESMF
applications. In addition, each application supports the standard \verb+ --help + command line argument, providing a brief description of how to invoke
the program.
