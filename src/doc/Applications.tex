The main product delivered by ESMF is the ESMF library that allows application
developers to write programs based on the ESMF API. In addition to the 
programming library, ESMF distributions come with a small set of applications
that are of general interest to the ESMF community. These applications utilize
the ESMF library to implement features such as printing general information
about the ESMF installation, or generating regrid weight files. The provided
ESMF applications are intented to be used as standard command line tools.

The bundled ESMF applications are built and installed during the usual ESMF
installation process, which is described in detail in the ESMF User's Guide section "Building and Installing the ESMF". After the installation the
applications will be located in the binary directory that was specified during
the installation. The exact installation specific path is available to the user
via the {\tt esmf.mk} mechanism in form of the Makefile variable
{\tt ESMF\_APPSDIR}. The ESMF User's Guide discusses the
{\tt esmf.mk} mechanism in more detail in section "Compiling and Linking User
Code against an ESMF Installation".

The following sections provide in-depth documentation of the bundled ESMF
applications. In addition, each application supports the standard \verb+ --help + command line argument, providing a brief description of how to invoke
the program.
