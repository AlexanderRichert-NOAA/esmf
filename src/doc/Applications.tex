The ESMF distribution comes with a set of applications that are thought to be
of general use to ESMF users. The applications utilize the ESMF library to
implement features such as printing general information about the ESMF
installation, or generating regrid weight files. The provided ESMF applications
are implemented as standard command line tools.

The bundled ESMF applications are built and installed during the usual ESMF
installation process, which is described in detail in the ESMF User's Guide. 
After the installation the applications will be located in the binary directory
that was specified during the installation. The exact installation specific
path is available to the user via the {\tt esmf.mk} mechanism in form of the
Makefile variable {\tt ESMF\_APPSDIR}. The ESMF User's Guide discusses the
{\tt esmf.mk} mechanism in more detail.

The following sections provide documentation of the bundled ESMF application command line tools.
