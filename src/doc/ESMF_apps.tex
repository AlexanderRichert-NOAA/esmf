The ESMF bundled applications are command line tools that are included
with the ESMF library distribution.  They can be used for tasks like
printing general information about an ESMF installation, or generating
regrid weight files.  These applications need to be built, it is also
handy to set up a path alias to them, before they 
can be used as standard command line tools.

The applications are built in the process of installing ESMF.  Refer 
to section \ref{InstallESMF} for instructions on how to complete the 
installation process.  Once ESMF is installed, the {\tt ESMF\_APPSDIR} 
variable, available in the esmf.mk file,
will point to the directory containing the application command line 
tools.  There are two options at this point: 1. add the {\tt ESMF\_APPSDIR}
directory to the local {\tt PATH} environment variable or 2. set the 
{\tt ESMF\_APPSDIR} environment variable from esmf.mk in the local 
environment.  On the bash shell this would be:

1. "export PATH=\$PATH:[value of ESMF\_APPSDIR from esmf.mk]"

2. "export ESMF\_APPSDIR=[value of ESMF\_APPSDIR from esmf.mk]"

There is a --help option available on the command line for each 
of these applications.  This will give information on the proper
arguments needed to use the applications.  These applications can
also be used as part of a larger user application, refer to the
