\section{How to Contact User Support and Find Additional Information}
\label{sec:Support}
The ESMF team can provide assistance in running the demonstration application 
{\tt ESMF\_COUPLED\_FLOW} at your site.  For user support, please contact 
\htmladdnormallink{esmf\_support@ucar.edu}{mailto:esmf_support@ucar.edu}.  

While we are delighted to have potential users experiment with ESMF, the
ESMF team can offer only limited support to those who are trying to incorporate 
the framework into applications at this early stage.  The ESMF is still
too young to be considered viable infrastructure for active research and 
operational codes.  

More information on the ESMF project as a whole is available on the 
ESMF website, \htmladdnormallink{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}.  
The website includes a description of ESMF testbed applications, related projects,
the ESMF management structure, and much more.  Those curious about specific 
interfaces should refer to the \htmladdnormallink
{{\it ESMF Reference Manual for Fortran90}}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu/esmf_docs/
ESMF_refdoc}, which contains a detailed listing and description of 
the ESMF API.  Other documents available on the ESMF site include an exhaustive
\htmladdnormallink{{\it Requirements Document}}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu/esmf_docs/ESMF_reqdoc} 
and an \htmladdnormallink{{\it Architecture Document}}
{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu/esmf_docs/ESMF_archdoc}.

\section{How to Submit Comments on the ESMF Design}
\label{sec:Submission}
Comments on the ESMF API and design may be submitted to the ESMF development 
using on-lines forms available from the {\bf Development} link on the ESMF 
website, \htmladdnormallink{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}.  
The {\bf Development} 
link on the ESMF website also includes on-line forms for the submission of 
new requirements, if it seems that the current API does not satisfy the needs of 
your application.  We welcome input on any aspect of the ESMF project; general
questions and comments should be sent to \htmladdnormallink{esmf@ucar.edu}
{mailto:esmf@ucar.edu}.
