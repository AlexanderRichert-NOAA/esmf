\label{sec:Support}
The ESMF team can provide assistance in using the framework in your
applications.
For user support, please contact

More information on the ESMF project as a whole is available on the 
ESMF website, \htmladdnormallink{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu}.  
The website includes a description of ESMF testbed applications, related projects,
the ESMF management structure, and much more.  Those curious about specific 
interfaces should refer to the \htmladdnormallink
{{\it ESMF Reference Manual for Fortran}}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu/esmf_docs/
ESMF_refdoc}, which contains a detailed listing and description of 
the ESMF API.  Other documents available on the ESMF site include an exhaustive

and an \htmladdnormallink{{\it ESMF Developer's Guide}}{http://www.esmf.ucar.edu/esmf_docs/dev_guide} 
that details our project procedures and conventions.

\section{How to Submit New Requirements}
\label{sec:Submission}

your application.  We welcome input on any aspect of the ESMF project; general
