\newcommand{\apiStatusCompatibleVersion}[1]{This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting at #1. Code written to compile with any ESMF release since #1 will also compile with the current ESMF release.}
\newcommand{\apiStatusModifiedSinceVersion}[1]{This interface was modified since ESMF version #1 was released. Code written to compile with the current ESMF release is not automatically guaranteed to compile against previous ESMF releases. If this sort of user code compatibility with earlier ESMF versions is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this interface to features that were available in ESMF release #1.}

\newcommand{\apiDeprecatedArgWithReplacement}[1]{DEPRECATED ARGUMENT! Please use the argument {\tt #1} instead.}
